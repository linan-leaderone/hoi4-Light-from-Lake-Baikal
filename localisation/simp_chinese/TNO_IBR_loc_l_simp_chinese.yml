 IBR_Non_Italian_Catholics_desc:0 "对传统天主教价值观的坚持与忠诚使得我们与前盟友，即意大利人走得很近。但分道扬镳之后，我们得放宽眼界，把目光投向其他那些与我们秉持着同样价值观的国家。\n\n外交部认为爱尔兰及法国都是极好的外交目标。虽然这两国在令人作呕的团结协定中都有一席之位，但我们可以凭借文化和宗教纽带跟他们拉近关系，而德国在这方面的狂妄自大将对我们有利。除此之外，此举也能让我们一窥德国佬的同盟到底在酝酿什么诡计。但愿这些纽带能够实实在在地让我们有机会深化和这两个欧洲天主教国家的关系。"

 IBR_Our_Frenemies_desc_TFL:0 "我们同英国的历史孽缘导致了两国人民关系的剑拔弩张。但在联合王国对德战争失败，我们采取不结盟外交政策之后，似乎又有了建立外交关系的曙光。在保持尊重，求同存异的前提下，访问该英伦三岛对我们的国际地位分毫无损。倘若能够改善伊英关系，甚至增强军事合作，德国的身旁将再添一刺，而我们在欧洲也会多一份力来对付前三头的老朋友。"
 IBR_Our_Frenemies_desc_old:0 "历史上的仇恨让我们与英格兰及苏格兰人的关系长久以来一直很糟糕，令人痛心。考虑到联合王国已经解体，其成员也已卑躬屈膝，我们或许可以借助这个新环境重启外交。只要我们寻求保持尊重，不逾越文化差异的界限，访问英伦三岛肯定不会损害我们的地位。改善双边关系的举措也许能加强联系，在给德国再下个绊子的同时加强和欧洲的关系、助力我们对付原三头同盟的“友邦”。"
 IBR_Down_In_Good_Hope:0 "展望好望角"
 IBR_Down_In_Good_Hope_desc:0 "南非是我们外交计划的下一个目标。众所周知，开普敦和日耳曼尼亚之间的关系往往十分紧张。南非可能借由中立独善其身于世界风云，但也因此在德国的贼船上越绑越紧。鉴于我们与那位欧洲霸主的矛盾，南非应该很容易就相信我们的诚意。\n\n与南非建立联系也有望为我们赢得英语世界其他国家，尤其是自由国家组织的青睐。我们现在在外交领域的一切行动都必须对外界释放一个信号，我们已经准备好与过去以欧洲为中心的外交政策切割。与南非接洽将是朝这一目标迈出的重要一步。"
 IBR_Journey_East:0 "东方之旅"
 IBR_Journey_East_desc:0 "在寻找有潜力加强关系的国家的过程中，我们把目光投向了东欧，特别是与德国结盟的匈牙利和罗马尼亚。两国都在50年代经济崩溃的遗留问题以及各自新征服领土上的分离主义暴力冲突中遭受重创。尽管同病相怜，但领土争端和激烈竞争造成的仇恨使两个国家过于脆弱和分裂，无力抵御德国的进一步入侵。如果我们打开外交渠道，我们也许能够消解外交孤立的危险，从而加强他们和我们的地位。"

 IBR_The_Lords_Arabia_desc:0 "意大利和土耳其如今在中东地区有着大量的狂热反对分子，鉴于二者都背弃了三头同盟，我们应该借此良机削弱意土两国，想想我们冷淡的关系一旦恶化可能发生的糟糕事，这么做才算公平。\n\n中东最大的焦点之一就是阿拉伯。这个由沙特家族统一的封建国家在发现巨量石油之后经济爆炸性增长，成为了许多国家外交使团的目标。我们也该迅速行动起来，和这些黑金流沙滋养的贵族建立关系。一份有利的石油贸易协定会对我们的经济大有裨益，国家安全也会因此改善。我们可不能落在其他地中海大国的后面。"

 IBR_Down_Under:0 "前往南方大陆"
 IBR_Down_Under_desc:0 "OFN的联盟不仅仅局限在西半球。在多次向东远行至亚洲的外交任务后，我们认识到了与澳大利亚建立关系的意义。和其他国家类似，我们可以借此寻求与整个民主阵营更紧密的关联。除此之外，如果能建立良好的外交关系，两国还可以成为贸易伙伴。澳大利亚是蕴藏大量自然资源的丰饶之地，而那些资源对支撑着我国军工复合体的产业至关重要。"
 IBR_Everyone_Knows_Iberia:0 "所有人都认识伊比利亚"
 IBR_Everyone_Knows_Iberia_desc:0 "我们面向全球的外交即将收尾，而这也意味着我们终于能走出简单的欧洲中心主义外交政策的阴影。凭借这些，我们证明了伟大的伊比利亚联盟已经准备好与全世界的许多国家做生意，并建立更紧密的纽带。\n\n这也说明了三头同盟的崩溃算是因祸得福。虽说在希特勒激烈的权力博弈之后建立这样的反德同盟很有必要，但如今放眼全球，我们的机遇可比先前多得多了。我们不会落后于其他那些封闭的欧洲国家。我们的国家受人瞩目。"
 IBR_Focus_on_Us:0 "专注本土"
 IBR_Focus_on_Us_desc:0 "三头同盟瓦解之后，我们决定奉行相对的外交孤立政策。考虑到国际关系现状，这或许不是个坏主意。我们现在有机会集中精力处理国内问题，从而改善我国社会经济结构。由于葡萄牙和西班牙两国的匆忙统一，我们有许多问题亟待处理。不过，解决这些问题之后，我们将再次傲然屹立——这次不是与其他地中海国家肩并肩，而是独自屹立。这样，我们就可以在不依赖别人的情况下证明我国的价值，这更有利于提升我们的威望。"
 IBR_Foreign_Mistrust:0 "警惕境外势力"
 IBR_Foreign_Mistrust_desc:0 "这样做正是意料之中。土耳其通过机会主义的外交行动将自己巩固成为一个正式的民族国家才没多久，为什么他们这么快就放弃了这种做法？与此同时，意大利人在一个世纪内两次背叛了他们的德国盟友。在其相当短暂的历史中，不计后果的民族统一主义和膨胀的野心决定了它们在国际领域的行动方式。\n\n另一方面，我们伊比利亚有着悠长的国家历史和包容的外交传统。这群傻瓜放弃互惠互利的反德联盟不是我们的错。然而，我们从中得到的教训几乎同样有益：我们不能再盲目信任其他国家了。相反，我们会奉行适度的怀疑主义外交政策。外国势力必须证明自己是出于好意。"
 IBR_Bare_Minimum_Interaction:0 "最小程度沟通"
 IBR_Bare_Minimum_Interaction_desc:0 "显然，我们不能再轻易相信那些外国人了。在信任意大利人和土耳其人的过程中，我们已经在军事、情报和经济机密方面出让了大量国家安全利益。然而，同样现实的是，完全孤立于国际领域也会产生非常可怕的后果。为了不损害我们的经济，保持贸易关系和建立新的贸易关系至关重要。同样重要的是获取有关国际政治活动和联盟建设的情报。如果德国人卷土重来或者其他势力决定干预伊比利亚事务，我们绝对不能孤军奋战、毫无准备。因此，我们有必要同经过遴选的外国势力建立一定关系。我们将保留中断联系的选项，以防出现任何意外。"

 IBR_greater_secrecy_tt:0 "我们会扩大反间谍活动。"
 IBR_Greater_Secrecy_desc:0 "三头同盟的瓦解不仅在经济和军事领域，而且在情报领域也产生了巨大的影响。随着以前的信息共享和联合演习宣告终止，我们的情报部门不仅出现硬件设施的缺口，而且缺乏指导。因此，我们得设法加大拨款力度以招募更多人员并购置装备。在这个充满不确定性的时代，我们必须确保反间谍活动正常进行。绝不能让意大利或者土耳其间谍发现我们的半点漏洞。"

 IBR_Emphasize_Union:0 "强调团结"
 IBR_Emphasize_Union_desc:0 "三头同盟的解体以及随后与拉丁伙伴的分道扬镳对于伊比利亚联盟来说是一场巨大的磨难，它不仅给我们的外交方针带来了严峻的形势，还大大推动了伟大联盟内部的各种分离主义和民族主义运动。我们必须强调，伊比利亚联盟是一个统一的伊比利亚国家；每个人都不再仅仅是葡萄牙或者西班牙的公民，而是一个拥有独立身份和遗产的伊比利亚人。一个共同的目标和一个新的伊比利亚认同将我们团结到一起，赋予我们力量。正因如此，我们应该毫不犹豫地朝着这伟大的团结张开双臂，在如今的这个艰难的时代更应如此。为此我们已经推进了更多的宣传工作。"
 IBR_Arriba_Iberia:0 "伊比利亚万岁！"
 IBR_Arriba_Iberia_desc:0 "开明的领导人们决定举办一场盛大的活动，庆祝伟大的伊比利亚及其理念，提高群众的信心，加强联盟的团结。伊比利亚的人们忍受住了艰难险阻，顶住了日耳曼威胁的生存压力，经受住了过去三头同盟的狡诈多端。独自遨游地中海不是一种诅咒，而是深入塑造国家与民族历史的伟大机遇。伊比利亚人有许多理由为他们的人民和成就骄傲。\n\n也许我们该设定一个新的节日来庆祝伊比利亚人的联盟。"
 IBR_Great_Masses:0 "广大信众"
 IBR_Great_Masses_desc:0 "很幸运我们的民众仍坚持着优良的传统价值观和唯一正信。几个世纪以来，伊比利亚一直是基督正教的堡垒。而德国秩序下的欧洲以及其他地方却有着大量的异教徒拒绝了天主教，转而选择将危险的意识形态作为自己的教条或者倒向毫无意义的虚无主义。\n\n如有必要，伊比利亚人民随时可以响应召唤，躬身天主。事实证明了信仰仍比政府指示更能牵引民众，我们应该利用民众的信仰，在这艰难时刻保持联盟的团结和政府的威信。在联盟的各个城市举办大型广播集会或许是个不错的主意。"

 IBR_Praise_Caudillos_desc:0 "伊比利亚有两位共掌权力的伟大领袖，他们曾各自统领一国子民，而后共掌航舵，引领联盟穿过变革的风雨。面对残酷的国内冲突、无休止的殖民地叛乱、大国强权的威压，无论何时，两位考迪罗始终站在最前面。因此，两位领袖在广大伊比利亚人民心目中都树立了良好的形象。我们运用他们的形象打造了卓有成效的个人崇拜，而批评者声称这是在复刻德国人的元首崇拜、理应受到谴责。此类毁谤没有提到的是，伊比利亚的两位考迪罗不必依赖洗脑宣传，因为他们已经完全证明了自己身为伟大领袖的威望。若能进一步抬高两位考迪罗的形象，并使之与流行文化进一步融合，我们也许能够更好地影响广大人民，并在逆境中促进团结。"
 IBR_Fortify_Colonies:0 "巩固殖民地"
 IBR_Fortify_Colonies_desc:0 "在前三头同盟的经贸合作已经破裂的情况下，殖民地就成为了伊比利亚的经济支柱，保证帝国对殖民地的主权和控制也变得尤为重要。我们有渠道表明德国人正在觊觎我们余数不多的殖民地，就像他们之前盯上葡萄牙人的莫桑比克和安哥拉那样。决不能让剩下的殖民地重蹈葡萄牙的覆辙，为此我们制定了一份巩固各战略要地的计划。"

 IBR_Post_Bombing_Council_desc:0 "马德里公路的失败让我们意识到了单纯下达行政决策的体制有多么无能，以及官僚制度有多么冗余。随后一年被到处否决毫无成果的辩论使我们更加清楚地看到，在当前的体制下，我们做不出任何有意义的决策。\n\n而拉科鲁尼亚爆炸案中的加利西亚人差点杀死了我们敬爱的考迪罗，这场悲剧撕裂了整个联盟，也震惊了考迪罗，他们下定决心要建立一套更稳定的政府体系。\n\n于是伊比利亚委员会应运而生，这个委员会将致力于处理地方冲突，协助各地达成协定，避免过去制度带来的官僚主义池沼。随之而来的便是委员会的性质问题，委员会到底只是单纯的咨询机构，还是享有一定的立法权力？"

 IBR_slow_burn_lib_desc:0 "在此之前，有识之士已经多次指出，仓促进行不间断的全面改革将危及伊比利亚的存续。若我们还要疾速推行全面改革，天知道人民接下来会迈向何方！分离主义大行其道？赤匪重回政治舞台？天知道！为了阻止伊比利亚上演此类悲剧，我们必须搁置自由化。自由化当然还是要搞的，但其推进速度只能以伊比利亚未来的稳定为前提。"
 IBR_alter_succession:0 "修改继承法"
 IBR_alter_succession_desc:0 "伊比利亚未来确实需要些改变，这是肯定的，这些改变也是我们维护伊比利亚长期存续的要义。为避免可能导致国家分裂的继任危机，我们必须就遴选考迪罗的程序做些调整。与以往由考迪罗亲自指定接班人不同，以后将由委员会选出未来的考迪罗，以求在委员会成员之间调和关系、达成一致，进而维护国家稳定。此举有望避免未来灾难性的领导层危机。"
 IBR_let_in:0 "敞开大门"
 IBR_let_in_desc:0 "我们成功了。最庞大、最繁杂的工作已经完成，在我们手中，未来已经有了保障。或许会有零星的宵小之徒躲在阴暗角落里叽叽喳喳，说我们的改革还不够，说我们的改革不过是为了保全自己，但他们知道个屁？！他们那可怜的脑容量连最起码的利害关系都理解不了。不这样做的话，谋杀、战争和混乱必将蹂躏我们神圣的伊比利亚。我们已经行了必行之事，我们拯救了伊比利亚。在此过程中，我们保护了伊比利亚全体人民的生命，而他们无法想象自己曾与死神有多近……"
 IBR_state_of_the_union:0 "联盟现状"
 IBR_state_of_the_union_desc:0 "现在是时候审视伊比利亚的现状了。由于我们最近的政策旨在稳定联盟，所以我们更关心能否确保这些政策长期落实。终于，我们在维护自身地位和延续近期政策之间找到了共通点——必须审视伊比利亚联盟的现状。"
 IBR_open_the_council:0 "开放委员会"
 IBR_open_the_council_desc:0 "你要是连问题是啥都不知道，那解决问题有啥用？为了搞清楚要解决的问题，我们需要开放伊比利亚委员会。把全国各地的商人和官员聚到一起，我们就能捋出亟需解决的问题。另一个好处是，我们可以把委员会变成橡皮图章，用它批准任何我们认为必要的措施。"
 IBR_stand_against_liberal_influences:0 "对抗自由主义影响"
 IBR_stand_against_liberal_influences_desc:0 "有这样一种疫病，它正在全社会蔓延。它对我们所珍爱之物的侵蚀迫在眉睫，它让我们变得软弱衰朽。没错，这毒瘤就是“自由主义”，它的存在不可容忍。我们必须阻止它，不惜一切代价！把它在伊比利亚的存在斩尽杀绝！无论何时，无论何地，只要有人胆敢传播此类腌臜，我们就会站在遏止他们的最前线！不发狂，就灭亡！"
 IBR_plans_of_attack:0 "进攻方案"
 IBR_plans_of_attack_desc:0 "有问题要处理是一回事，真正知道该怎么处理问题是另外一回事。前者纯粹是打嘴炮，从来都不会采取足够果断的行动来阻止他们想要阻止的事情；而后者知道该如何把事情办好。显然，我们希望成为后者。要保护联盟免受分裂分子和自由主义者的侵害，我们得制定个计划。我们要全速开动脑筋，想出切实可行的办法抹除这些异见分子。"
 IBR_feign_openness:0 "假装开放"
 IBR_feign_openness_desc:0 "我们需要让人民相信，我们不是那种单纯的暴戾专制的阴谋集团，这样才能让合作的想法不仅仅停留在口头上。这是信任的问题。为了从任何人那里得到任何有价值的东西，我们需要让他们认为自己不会为此被吊死。我们得表现得即将在政治观点上执行开明政策，以此来哄骗他们放松警惕、说几句真心话。这对那些更容易上当受骗的极端分子同样有效，我们只需一项法令便可击杀二鸟。"
 IBR_let_them_in:0 "敞开大门"
 IBR_let_them_in_desc:0 "大多数委员依旧冷嘲热讽、对我们的努力持怀疑态度。诱饵已经投放，但大多数人已经对我们那套诱饵见怪不怪了。通常情况下，我们提供的东西不多——微不足道的改革，若干空洞的承诺。已经没人再上当了。为了在和他们的来往中取得进展，我们需要说服他们，让他们相信现在得做些改变了，让他们相信某些地方即将发生变革。为此，我们得付出比平时更多的代价。\n\n误导委员们、让他们以为我们会为他们做点好事的最好办法就是装腔作势。为了把他们带进坑，我们会赐予他们都渴望的东西——权力。我们不会只向他们忏悔自己之前的所作所为，而是宣布委员会的权责将怎样大幅扩张，并确保这一切将在下次会议上详细阐述。"
 IBR_lock_them_up:0 "紧锁大门"
 IBR_lock_them_up_desc:0 "诱饵准备好了。政客们已经被花言巧语和授予权力的承诺迷得神魂颠倒——当然，他们永远也不会获得权力的。只需大手一挥，我们就能解决掉这些委员。检查陷阱将是我们对抗委员会的第一步。任何看起来过于激进的人都将被监禁起来，那些异见分子也一样。毕竟，不绝对忠于伊比利亚的人是靠不住的。\n\n与此同时，其余的人将被强行留在会议室里，他们将待上远远超过必要的时间。这不是出于残忍，而是出于先发制人。他们中的大多数人都会失去对工作的热情，这种情况下他们是不可能做好工作的。因此，他们只能强迫自己重新调整优先事项。这不是最优解决方案，但却是必要的。"
 IBR_address_the_real_problems:0 "解决真正的问题"
 IBR_address_the_real_problems_desc:0 "终于，我们需要的人已经聚到一起了。为此我们花了很长时间，但所有的阴谋家和狡狐都已经被我们控制住了。没有我们的允许，他们是不会离开会议室的。这本不该是必要之举的，可委员会有个回避问题的坏毛病。所以，为了伊比利亚的利益，我们必须帮他们必须改掉这个坏毛病。为了委员们的利益，它会改掉的。\n\n这些虫子会坐下来，开始思考。他们会被给予一个时间限制，一旦时间到了，他们会给出他们的解决方案。当他们自怨自艾时，我们会自己想办法解决问题的。这些懦夫真值得我们花力气留住吗？"
 IBR_dissolve_the_council:0 "解散伊比利亚委员会"
 IBR_dissolve_the_council_desc:0 "经过慎重考虑，我们认为伊比利亚委员会已经没有维持运作的价值了。哪怕只是扮演不做实际工作、只需提供建议的角色，委员会也没能证明自己存在的必要。委员会不仅容易腐化，而且极易受恐怖分子渗透。稍微有点脑子的人都能看明白，像这种状态的存在显然没有什么价值可言。所以，这个委员会不用再继续发言了。"
 IBR_supremacy_of_the_caudillos:0 "考迪罗至高无上！"
 IBR_supremacy_of_the_caudillos_desc:0 "再没人能比两位考迪罗威望更高了，他们将统治整个伊比利亚。为什么不？他们可是最有资格、最适合这份工作的人！谁要是敢说个不字，那就是把叛国二字写在脑门上！我们的伟大领袖不容置疑，任何胆敢质疑他们的人必须被清除掉！"
 IBR_pardon_the_loyal:0 "宽恕忠仆"
 IBR_pardon_the_loyal_desc:0 "虽然委员会里充斥着臭鱼烂虾，但不能因此就将其一棍子打死。委员会中其实不乏道德上的典范，只是人们不愿以他们为榜样罢了。这些敬业的人没有理由因他们同僚的行径而受罚，就算有理由，那也是受赏的理由。我们必须允许他们继续为伊比利亚服务，要是把他们都关起来，事情就办不成了。"
 IBR_get_over_it:0 "忘掉它！"
 IBR_get_over_it_desc:0 "伊比利亚委员会已经从地球上消失了，永远消失了！通通给老子闭嘴！任何被发现想回到委员会黑暗时期的人都是叛国贼！毋庸置疑，必须把这些狗贼从所有重要岗位上清除出去，以免这些人把我们拉进更黑暗的深渊！"
 IBR_a_new_legislature:0 "全新的立法机构"
 IBR_a_new_legislature_desc:0 "我们的两位考迪罗才华横溢，可也并非无所不能，比如处置法律制定过程中的细微差别。因此，我们有必要设计一套新制度来处理法律制定的细节。当然，这套新体制将在两位考迪罗的授权下运作，而且必须得到他们的明确批准。"
 IBR_absolute_loyalty:0 "绝对忠诚"
 IBR_absolute_loyalty_desc:0 "政府只忠实履行职责是远远不够的。它必须更加忠诚。只有随时准备为伊比利亚流血牺牲的人才配称之为忠诚，否则忠诚不绝对就是绝对不忠诚。任何想在政府中占有一席之地的人都必须百分之百地效忠两位考迪罗。"
 IBR_cycle_the_regional_governments:0 "地方政府轮换"
 IBR_cycle_the_regional_governments_desc:0 "简单地说，让某个人去管治同民族的人是个很糟糕的主意。狭隘的民族主义仍然存在，并且意图取代伊比利亚认同。在这等狭隘的民族主义归于消灭之前，任何官员都不能在同族聚居的地方任职。这些人一旦抱团，他们定会将本族利益置于国家利益之上。我们绝不能允许这种情况发生。因此，我们会强令行政人员去管理其原籍地以外的地方。"
 IBR_work_out_our_differences:0 "解决分歧"
 IBR_work_out_our_differences_desc:0 "虽然确保联邦能够对其领土行使一定的控制力至关重要，但必须仔细审视用以实现这一目标的法律，以免引起不必要的反对浪潮。我们将与地方官员磋商，弄清激怒国内各少数民族的主要因素，以便接下来起草新法律时尽量避免此类情况。"
 IBR_new_fundemental_laws:0 "新基本法"
 IBR_new_fundemental_laws_desc:0 "我们目前的立法非常成功，但这套律法不能一成不变。时代总是在变，我们得制定新的法律法规跟上时代步伐。有了地方官员的信息支持，佐之以绝对忠诚的立法机关，我们可以开始修订起草适用于整个伊比利亚的新法律。这项新法规对全体伊比利亚人一视同仁，无论他们在国内居于何处。这套法律或将严酷，但它将力保公正。新立法将引领伊比利亚迈入现代。"
 IBR_peace_at_last:0 "终归安宁"
 IBR_peace_at_last_desc:0 "终于，我们的努力有了成果。天佑伊比利亚，再没人能威胁她的稳定，她再不会成为任何破坏者的牺牲品。新的地方官已经走马上任，他们完全忠于联邦；新的律法已经制定落实，半岛上所有人都能保证享有平等公正的待遇；新的立法机构正高效运转，他们将竭智尽忠，直面看似无法克服的挑战、捍卫伊比利亚；最重要的是，我们的政权坚如磐石，内部不存在任何妄图推翻我们的人。终于，伊比利亚的一切终归安宁。"
 IBR_our_loyal_advisors:0 "我们忠诚的顾问"
 IBR_our_loyal_advisors_desc:0 "经过仔细审议，我们认为应当允许委员会保持其目前的立场。他们敬业、忠诚，为完善联盟而尽心竭力。考虑到他们对自己的命运很满意，让他们保持现状可以避免很多麻烦。虽然需要付出些努力才能确保这项措施不会适得其反，但此举的前景不可估量。"
 IBR_Place_Everyone_Everyone_Place:0 "职为各人，各司其职"
 IBR_Place_Everyone_Everyone_Place_desc:0 "尽管委员会纯粹是咨询性质的，但其成员都对自己的命运很满意。别说我们不够大方——每名委员及其家人都将在豪华套房集中居住并得到悉心照料，而且他们的要求都会得到满足。当然，前提是他们效忠伊比利亚。为了确保他们的忠诚，或者至少作为筹码，如果他们不忠诚的话，新的聚居点将允许我们密切关注他们的家人。当然，我们这么做这只是为了安全起见。"
 IBR_Check_Advisors:0 "审查委员会成员"
 IBR_Check_Advisors_desc:0 "到目前为止，委员会还没出过什么差错，不过没人能保证这种情况会持续多久。我们最多能做的就是采取预防措施，以确保国家的敌人不会钻进这个联邦最受信任的机构之一。天知道这些人一旦上位会干出什么好事！我们可以动用各种手段来审查委员，确保他们如自己声称的那般尽职尽责。审查越细致越好，以此确保不留死角。"
 IBR_Lets_Keep_Order:0 "维持秩序"
 IBR_Lets_Keep_Order_desc:0 "我们重视伊比利亚的稳定高于一切。一般情况下，伊比利亚委员会是联盟稳定的积极因素——他们就各类问题提出见解，如果没有他们，这些问题大概会被忽视。这些建议可以让法律得到更好的调整，尽可能地确保其高效。然而，他们有时也会起到反效果。委员会成员有时会给人以他们有权获得更多权力的印象。虽然他们很敬业，但他们并不需要更多东西来继续工作。让他们明白这一事实非常重要。"
 IBR_Fully_Functioning_Council:0 "正常运转的委员会"
 IBR_Fully_Functioning_Council_desc:0 "委员们清楚自己的位置，他们也十分忠诚。令人遗憾的是，原本我们预估委员会能够正常运作，而事实上似乎我们错了。时代在变，除非我们也跟着改变，否则我们将被远远甩在后面。我们需要再务实一点。他们的意见必须更有分量，因为他们能够很好地洞察我们值得改进的地方。"
 IBR_Listen_Their_Suggestions:0 "听取委员会建议"
 IBR_Listen_Their_Suggestions_desc:0 "委员会的建议必须更有分量。就算让他们只负责发言而不必考虑其他，这也是不切实际的。我们应该更倾向于接纳他们的意见；这并不是为了接纳而接纳，而是因为我们必须承认，有时他们确实有自己的一套想法。毕竟，身为委员会的一员，既然能够能跻身其中，他们必然有一定的经验来支持自己的意见。"
 IBR_Listen_Regional_Government:0 "听取地方政府"
 IBR_Listen_Regional_Government_desc:0 "把地方政府排除在外是不恰当的。和委员会一样，各个地方及其政府对我们今天面临的问题都有其独到的想法。我们可以争取地方政府的支持，以调整即将到来的改革。"
 IBR_Respect_Our_Differences:0 "尊重差异"
 IBR_Respect_Our_Differences_desc:0 "伊比利亚的每个民族各有其“特色”。这些“特色”有时会让管辖这些民族变得相当困难，要让他们所有人都井然有序是件令人相当头疼的事。我们与其强行把他们抻直，不如设计一套新体制，让这些少数民族保持忠诚。虽然自治是不可能的，但我们仍然可以达成一个互利的协议。作为对联盟的忠诚和无条件支持的交换，我们很可能会对联盟内部某些不那么有害的“特色”睁一只眼闭一只眼。"
 IBR_Revamp_Council:0 "改组委员会"
 IBR_Revamp_Council_desc:0 "骨架已经搭好，现在我们必须着手为其填充血肉了。我们将制定一套新的法律，确保委员会的新地位，并适当地将我们的想法长期落实下去。按委员会和地方政府的说法，待到立法工作完成，委员会将以崭新的面貌面向世人。"
 IBR_Just_Dodged_Bullet:0 "我们躲过了一劫"
 IBR_Just_Dodged_Bullet_desc:0 "我们成功了。整个伊比利亚半岛的紧张局势都在降温，大多数人似乎已经失去了继续癫狂的意愿。联盟内部仍有许多持不同政见者，但他们会发现，人们对他们的胡言乱语的容忍程度大大降低了。委员会的新地位似乎缓解了许多人的担忧，而且随着联盟对委员会权力的放宽，许多人重新效忠联盟了。我们从那些妄图分裂伊比利亚的人手中拯救了它，而所需要做的只是调整委员会的地位。"
 IBR_Preparing_Democracy:0 "准备民主"
 IBR_Preparing_Democracy_desc:0 "在冒险进行伊比利亚半岛30多年来首次自由选举之前，还有若干关键问题亟需处理。在走向民主的最后阶段，我们将尽最大努力确保此次过渡能使国家朝正确的方向前进。显然，这条道路对于联盟的稳定确有必要，但这一进程究竟将如何演进有待决定。"
 IBR_Setting_Elections:0 "安排选举"
 IBR_Setting_Elections_desc:0 "不事先做足准备的话，1970年新一届伊比利亚委员会的选举会很容易出现筹备方面的问题。组织伊比利亚第一次民主选举的巨大行政负担将在长期和短期的准备工作以及选举日当天显现。这是我国有史以来上最为重大的事件之一，因此在着手筹备的时候，我们务必要打牢基础、不留死角。"
 IBR_Observer_Question:0 "观察员问题"
 IBR_Observer_Question_desc:0 "委员会中的某些成员提议由国际观察员监督选举，以确保民主进程的完整性。他们认为，除了巩固选举的合法性外，此举还将提高我们在世界民主国家中的外交地位。\n\n然而，也有一部分委员公开反对这一提议，称其是对伊比利亚国家主权的侵犯。甚至一些表面上支持民主的成员也反对这项措施，因而这一议题存在明显分歧。"
 IBR_Get_Ballot_Boxes:0 "放置投票箱"
 IBR_Get_Ballot_Boxes_desc:0 "既然要举行选举，那么每名登记选民都应该能够到投票箱前投票。倘若选民离最近的投票站太远，他们可能会因此被劝退。从民主的角度来看，这是个相当负面的后果。\n\n这一问题在乡村地区尤为突出，因为在伊比利亚广阔的内陆地区有许多小社区，远离大城市。正是在这些经常被遗忘的社区，可能需要采取特别行动，以确保选民的声音得到倾听。"
 IBR_Make_Suffrage_Lists:0 "编篡选举花名册"
 IBR_Make_Suffrage_Lists_desc:0 "目前的选民登记方案是否过于严格？还是说过于宽松？关于这一问题还存有争议。哪些伊比利亚人应该参与这场关乎国家未来的关键抉择？\n\n委员会内部的保守派建议谨慎行事，抨击任何放宽选举资格的建议。然而，全国各地纷纷传来了强烈呼声，他们敦促委员会和两位考迪罗“确保每个人的参与权”，而委员会内只有少数成员代表他们发言。两种论调互有长短，加之当前的选举筹备情况，选举花名册的制定势必会受到影响。"
 IBR_Special_Police_Deployments:0 "部署特别警察"
 IBR_Special_Police_Deployments_desc:0 "最近，越来越多的人指出，在即将到来的选举中，选民可能受到恐吓。日益增长的忧虑使得许多人呼吁在选举日增加警力，届时国民警卫队将在驱散潜在冲突、制止骚乱中发挥积极作用。\n\n虽然怨怒四起，但大多数负责选举筹备工作的官员都向委员会保证，诸如此类的担忧不过是杞人忧天，投票开始时一切都会在掌控之中。"
 IBR_Teach_Them_Their_Duty:0 "明确选民义务"
 IBR_Teach_Them_Their_Duty_desc:0 "解决行政方面的问题之后，现在轮到伊比利亚选民发声、履行他们的公民义务了。为选举进程奠定物质基础固然很好，但让人民转变思潮不可或缺。\n\n伊比利亚半岛已有数十年没进行过选举了，伊比利亚人安于现状，对改善国家的未来漠不关心——毫无疑问，这种趋势难以打破。但是我们相信，随着时间的推移，我们今天的大胆之举将为伊比利亚最终摆脱旧日枷锁吹响号角。"
 IBR_First_Campaign:0 "首次竞选活动"
 IBR_First_Campaign_desc:0 "在宣布人民即将参加民主选举之后不久，利益集团和政界人士便开始聚集起来、成立组织，而后合并成规模越来越大的政党和联盟，其中一些政党和联盟迅速崛起又迅速解散。随着时间推移，几个规模较大的政党已经初具形态，这在伊比利亚委员会中引发了日益广泛的担忧。\n\n倘若这些政党继续壮大并巩固其运动，代表现全国政府参加选举的国民联盟可能比预期更需要我们的帮助。因此，关于在竞选中进行何种程度的适当干预的闭门讨论正在委员会进行。"
 IBR_Special_Media_Coverage:0 "铺天盖地的报道"
 IBR_Special_Media_Coverage_desc:0 "随着竞选活动铺展开来，媒体将有必要报道选举，并向人民宣传选举的到来。要宣示此次选举的合法性，我们必须让伊比利亚人民了解这一重大事件。\n\n通过印刷品、广播和电视，我们旨在让伊比利亚的选民都了解即将发生的事情。随着新闻报道在全国进行，我们将屏息等待民主进程的展开。"
 IBR_Campaign_Style_Guide:0 "选举指南"
 IBR_Campaign_Style_Guide_desc:0 "不可否认，广泛的媒体报道确有必要，但在今后的任何活动中，一定程度的限制依然不可或缺。有些人认为这一决定是虚与委蛇，但在联盟成立以来最重要的日子到来之际，它们显然是确保稳定的急需措施。\n\n对选举运作方式的毫无裨益的批评只会助长怒火，这些抨击将被禁止在任何政治竞选或组织中使用。因此，在政治广告、演讲和所有其他形式的宣传中，特定的单词和短语将被禁用。"
 IBR_Rallies_In_Cities:0 "城市里的集会"
 IBR_Rallies_In_Cities_desc:0 "大都会中的伊比利亚人正举行越来越大规模的集会，兴奋地期待着选举。其他西班牙和葡萄牙城市，以及少数民族人口较多的大城市似乎也在追随这一趋势。\n\n他们对我们推进民主的热情令人振奋，但某些不那么讨人喜的家伙可能会从城市的活跃中受益。左派和自由派似乎都从中吸收了不少支持者，这一迹象不能不令人隐隐担忧。"
 IBR_Meetings_In_Villages:0 "乡村里的会见"
 IBR_Meetings_In_Villages_desc:0 "伊比利亚的农村地区是我国经常被忽视的“沉默的大多数”的家园。正是在这些地区，传统价值观仍然强大，教会在其社区中仍然享有崇高的地位。\n\n这些地方的选民可能倾向于大力度支持强硬和保守的声音，但最终这些可能都取决于我们在选举前怎样与他们接触。激励这些选民或将成为提高其投票率的关键。"
 IBR_Its_Now_Or_Never:0 "机不可失"
 IBR_Its_Now_Or_Never_desc:0 "随着竞选活动全面展开，有关即将到来的选举的讨论淹没了电视广播，全国各地的城镇聚集了越来越多的人。与此同时，农村地区的政治组织正以意想不到的趋势进行。\n\n几个年轻的政党在选举的前几周成功巩固了他们的支持，最著名的是倾向保守的人民联盟、主张经济自由化的民主革新党，以及力主社会自由的共和联盟。在迈入崭新的民主时代之际，我们的国家所面临的风险一如既往地高。"
 IBR_Jornada_Reflexion:0 "反思之日"
 IBR_Jornada_Reflexion_desc:0 "“我向你们保证，我做出这个决定经过了深思熟虑。过去几年的混乱没有击垮我们的联邦，但是我很确定，联邦已经奄奄一息。事实上，如果没有委员会的倾力协助与葡萄牙考迪罗的出色领导，这个联邦根本走不到今天。我见证了委员会在联邦存续上做出的巨大努力，如今我已经明白了改革的价值。目前的政府体制维持不了多久了。尽管很难说出口，但我还是认为下台是我唯一的选择。对伊比利亚的人民，我有太多的回忆，也有更多美好的期望，我不会让你们失望。我相信你们能让伊比利亚迈入更美好的明天。感谢你们对我的信任。”\n\n——弗朗西斯科·佛朗哥"

 IBR_our_place_on_the_world_stage_desc:0 "我们准备好重返远离已久的世界舞台了。伊比利亚统一前后的道路都无比艰难，但皇天不负有心人，我们最终还是准备好了面对世界。我们有很多种选择，可以根据我国和世界的情况进行调整。大西洋彼岸的美国人是一个不错的选择；北方的柏林也许会有长脑子的人；而地中海的老朋友们或许值得再见一面。"
 IBR_side_with_ofn:0 "倒向OFN"
 IBR_side_with_ofn_desc:0 "欧罗巴充满了欺骗与背叛。柏林的敌人，罗马和伊斯坦布尔的骗子都不值得信任。周遭无人能作为我们坚实的靠山，但在大西洋彼岸的华盛顿也许有值得我们相信的人。OFN是我们最好的选择，我们在欧洲的位置是一枚强而有力的筹码，现在就该与他们展开谈判。"
 IBR_mediterranean_reconciliation:0 "地中海和解"
 IBR_mediterranean_reconciliation_desc:0 "意大利人和土耳其人曾经是我们在危机四伏的世界上的可靠盟友。德国人企图控制全世界，而美国人则威胁着我国的主权，与双方任意一个结盟都只会让我们成为他们势力圈的一个成员，又一枚可以随时丢弃的棋子。但三头同盟存在时，我们在世界上的影响力则不同凡响，德美这些大国影响不了我们分毫。也许我们的老朋友没有我们之前想的那么糟糕，我们可以重新对话，尝试克服我们之间的分歧。"

 IBR_under_the_shadow_of_the_hugemon_desc:0 "德国人如今已是危险的对手。他们夺取了葡属非洲，扼杀了我们以往的贸易伙伴，而且还让我们自己去处理这事，德国人对我们并不友善。话虽如此，经历些许苦痛也可是必须之举。德国人的行动让我们得以毅然决然地雕琢伊比利亚的命运，如今的伊比利亚浴火重生，能够调取足够的资源，以一个强国的面貌去面对德国人。现在是该向柏林派遣一名外交官的时候了，我们将对德国人提出我们的条件。"
 IBR_visit_to_washington:0 "出访华盛顿"
 IBR_visit_to_washington_desc:0 "考虑到我们与美洲的共性和我们目前在欧洲的位置，我们决定拉近与美国及其OFN盟友的关系。为此我们必须向他们展示我们开展全新外交渠道的意愿与能力，外交部的部分高级公务员将被派往华盛顿担任特使。"

 IBR_import_modern_designs_desc:0 "伊比利亚现在的军队过时得可怕。我们的老式贝尔德哈坦克是个笑话，老式梅塞施密特和亨克尔的仿制品是笑话中的笑话，军队更是笑话中的笑话中的笑话……至少理论如此。而OFN的军队则站在进步的最前沿，向美国进口急需的新设备能迅速现代化我们乞丐样的军队：枪支、导弹、飞机、舰艇、坦克等等等等。我们现在需要的就是大量签署的支票，自此之后，伊比利亚就会变成德佬永远的噩梦。"
 IBR_american_military_advisors:0 "美国军事顾问"
 IBR_american_military_advisors_desc:0 "OFN与联盟的关系改善后，双方终于可以相互分享知识，并在各种国家事务上互利共赢，不分享哪算得上好友？而我们的军队，至少在一部分眼里它是一股不可忽视的力量，但凭借外国敏锐先进的眼光总可以指出它的不足之处并加以改进，这世上从来就没有真正的完美。美国人在最近的冲突中积累的经验对我们的军队现代化很有帮助，而我们要不要遵循他们的建议那又是另一个问题了。"

 IBR_ask_for_full_membership_desc:0 "伊比利亚是一个强大的国家，她团结一致，随时准备对世界开放。对我们而言，申请加入我们大西洋彼岸的朋友OFN并与其结盟才最符合我们的利益。如果OFN同意与我们结盟，我们将成为他们在欧洲的前锋。虽然成为一个海外联盟的前锋听上去有点不太妙，但肯定会让我们在OFN中取得巨大的影响力，而不是像反对派们所说成为某些三流国家。伊比利亚已经准备好了加入OFN，我们唯一要做的就是致函华盛顿。"

 IBR_propose_free_movement:0 "建议人员自由流动"
 IBR_propose_free_movement_desc:0 "我们应该要求前三头同盟的国家之间人员能自由流动。这题举措利远远大于弊，比如允许跨边界的便捷贸易可以减少三国间的关税。允许人员流动，边境上的紧张局势也将因此得到缓解，意大利和土耳其很可能会接受这个提议。"

 IBR_formally_end_the_embargo_desc:0 "在德国征服欧洲许多地区之后，我们不得不忍受德国在经济和外交上的双重霸权羞辱，即便这种羞辱十分短暂，但也让我们和感到背叛与威胁的其他地中海国家组建了三头同盟。三头同盟的建立正式切断了民族社会主义巨兽与南方诸国的许多联系，而作为三头同盟的一员，伊比利亚对德国势力圈实行了全面禁运。\n\n但现状由于德国经济的衰退和三头同盟的瓦解发生了变化。我们必须从俾斯麦的剧本中吸取教训，注重务实的现实政治。封锁固然是展示三巨头之间团结一致的必要举措，但实践中封锁或多或少地会出现一些或大或小的缺口。不过既然我们选择与北方的旧敌和解，那正式结束禁运就该放到日程的第一项了。结束禁运将加强双方的经济合作，既促进繁荣，又增进关系。"

 IBR_legalize_their_languages:0 "少民语言合法化"
 IBR_legalize_their_languages_desc:0 "禁止巴斯克语和加泰罗尼亚语完全是佛朗哥小心眼的报复行为。在这些民族因为违抗伊比利亚而遭受打压后，考迪罗就打算完全抹杀他们独特的民族文化。恢复这些民族讲自己的语言的权利并不是一种革命行为，只是回归伊比利亚半岛最古老的传统——多元文化。现在是时候终结这种不公了。"

 IBR_investigate_the_causes:0 "调查起因"
 IBR_investigate_the_causes_desc:0 "有什么原因？其实原因显而易见。伊比利亚有许多反民主的团体，无论左翼还是右翼，他们憎恶我们所代表的价值观，希望看到伊比利亚自由的毁灭。然而，仅仅是派遣大批警察逮捕我们认为有罪的人未免太过愚蠢。我们必须对每一个被怀疑的团体、个人和意识形态进行适当、彻底的调查。正当的程序胜过政治上的便利。"
 IBR_protect_the_congress:0 "保卫国会"
 IBR_protect_the_congress_desc:0 "保障安全和自由选举是目前议程上最重要的事项之一，但我们也必须保护国会免受直接行动的威胁。伊比利亚的历史上处处充斥着政治暴力。直到内战结束前，左派、法西斯主义者和军方还在互相残杀，每一次死亡事件都侵蚀着第二共和国的基础。任何投票者都不应该担心，某个嗜血的凶手出于意识形态的原因而射杀他们的代表。考迪罗将政府机构建设成了街垒，让我们加倍努力，将国民警卫队的职责扩大到保卫政府。"
 IBR_extend_the_vote:0 "扩大投票权"
 IBR_extend_the_vote_desc:0 "除了逮捕犯罪嫌疑人外，加大选举舞弊难度的最可靠方法就是清除虚假选票。第一次选举的投票率很高，但选举权并不广泛。21岁的投票年龄设得太高了，而且伊比利亚妇女在大多数其他民主国家享有普选权半个世纪后，仍要求符合选举资格，这未免有些荒谬了。此外，还有许多因小罪被定罪的公民被终身禁止投票。在国会中占多数的情况下，起草并签署必要的法律应该可以解决这些不公正问题。"
 IBR_faith_in_the_people:0 "相信人民"
 IBR_faith_in_the_people_desc:0 "还有什么能比将权力交到人民手中更能表达民主信仰的方式呢？伊比利亚人民或许做出了错误的选择，但我们选择相信人民，而人民也应该更好的解决办法。他们清楚表明伊比利亚不希望有分裂和内部冲突，人民渴求的是和平与正义。多年来，两位考迪罗一直坚称，在激进主义威胁存在的情况下，民主不能在伊比利亚发挥作用，但人民已经证明了他们的错误。考迪罗所恐惧的激进主义，只不过是政治的洪流中，少数误入歧途者的一时冲动而已。伊比利亚人经受住了考验，民主看上去没有任何缺陷。只要自由的伊比利亚还存在一天，民主的原则就将被我们贯彻，永不消亡。"
 IBR_ending_the_franquista:0 "废止前政权的法律"
 IBR_ending_the_franquista_desc:0 "想要废除前政权由严刑峻法、行监坐守和无情镇压组成的体制并非易事。可以预见保守派、长枪党甚至是人民联盟中的保守分子都会抵抗我们的改革，但改革势在必得。有太多的家庭被毫无根据的定罪拆散，有太多的常人因为一时疏忽而祸从口出，有太多的“小小考迪罗”沉醉于他们能对人民行使的权力……无需多言，正义无错。"
 IBR_legalize_the_opposition:0 "开放党禁"
 IBR_legalize_the_opposition_desc:0 "老实说，这个念头甚至让我们都有点害怕，但被考迪罗们取缔的政党必须能再度回到政治舞台。这些被取缔的政党里有社民主义者、社会主义者、共产主义者，甚至无政府主义者（虽然他们可能对参政不太感兴趣就是了）。右派会愤怒地口吐白沫，但我们必须站出来维护我们的民主原则。任何愿意参与民主并发誓不颠覆它的人都会受到欢迎，只要他们的政党不被发现干了什么错事。"
 IBR_audit_the_prisons:0 "审查监狱"
 IBR_audit_the_prisons_desc:0 "内战结束后伊比利亚的监狱都爆满了！无数的政治犯和因轻罪入狱的公民被粗暴地与真正的罪犯关在一起自生自灭，不能再让这种情况持续下去了，更别说监狱里那高的可怕的斗殴率、谋杀和自杀率。尽管审查监狱是一件痛苦而漫长的差事，但作为唯一公正的解决方法，我们必须用像梳子一样仔细地把定罪记录、司法系统和监狱都过一遍。我们必须坚定信念坚持下去，直到排除所有冤假错案。"
 IBR_close_down_tarrafal:0 "关闭塔拉法尔集中营"
 IBR_close_down_tarrafal_desc:0 "塔拉法尔是整个半岛上最臭名昭著最残酷的监狱。它完全是一个围绕政治犯集中营建造的堡垒，进入其中的人都无法离开——看守和工作人员除外。这个佛朗哥暴政的象征必须立即关闭，每一个工作人员都将被彻底调查。如果任何人被证明是犯下了刑事犯罪，如虐待囚犯，或是刑事犯罪的同谋，他将被相应处理。原本监狱里的囚犯将被分配到几个更小、更现代、更人道的监狱中，直到结束对他们罪行和审判的审查。塔拉法尔监狱将被停用，直到我们想出处理它的办法——也许它可以成为一个漂亮的博物馆或豪华酒店，而且只需要稍加改造？"

 IBR_UR_oil_crisis_desc:0 "糟糕！中东地区的动荡已经演变成了一场经济危机，媒体称其为“石油危机”。我们对中东石油的依赖使我们在这场危机中损失惨重，经济学家们预测伊比利亚将会遭遇一次经济衰退。至此境况，政府有必要挺身而出，带领伊比利亚渡过难关。"
 IBR_New_Economic_Program:0 "伊比利亚新经济计划"
 IBR_nep_iberia_tt:0 "我们会批准一项经济计划，来让伊比利亚走出危机。"
 IBR_New_Economic_Program_desc:0 "费尔南德斯-米兰达决定政府将施行“新经济计划”来渡过当前的危机。该计划将着重于增加政府开支，实行更公平的税收以及解决通货膨胀来保证此次危机中受害最严重的群体的福利。\n\n如果实施得当，费尔南德斯-米兰达的新经济计划可以让伊比利亚人活的比过去更好。但拥护自由市场的人强烈反对这项计划，认为它侵犯了市场自我修正的能力，而且成本也同样过高。"
 IBR_Secure_Minimum_Wage:0 "保障最低工资"
 IBR_secure_minimum_wage_tt:0 "最低工资会得到保障，工人的最低生活水平有了保证"
 IBR_Secure_Minimum_Wage_desc:0 "新经济计划的第一部分就是为所有工人制定一个最低工资。自从石油危机席卷伊比利亚以来，工人的处境每况愈下，在报纸上出现一次又一次的减薪之后，当局认为应该保证所有在工作的伊比利亚人不仅要能养活自己，也要能养活他的家庭。\n\n各企业的老板们声称这将大幅提高他们的成本，没法继续做生意，但面对经济衰退，我们每个人都必须做出牺牲。"
 IBR_Limit_Oil_Consumption:0 "限制石油消费"
 IBR_limit_oil_consumption_tt:0 "我们会开展一场宣传活动，鼓励人民用多种方式节约石油。"
 IBR_Limit_Oil_Consumption_desc:0 "保障最低工资后，我们就可以进入下一阶段了。我们将开展一次宣传运动，鼓励民众尽可能减少石油消费，缓解石油危机带来的原料压力。我们会鼓励乘坐公共交通、拼车、用木头替代汽油，希望落实之后能够减少我们对石油的依赖。\n\n当然石油公司也告诉我们，这种节约行为只会损害他们的底线利益从而让危机进一步恶化。但也正是他们的无能才将我们至于此种境地，所以不会管他们的。"
 IBR_Expand_Healthcare_UR:0 "扩大医疗保健服务"
 IBR_expanded_healthcare_tt:0 "危机当前，我们必须让公民的医疗保健得到保障乃至扩大。"
 IBR_Expand_Healthcare_UR_desc:0 "在石油危机撼动经济之后，全伊比利亚人对生活质量的急剧下降可是有目共睹。当局决不能容忍这种情况，因此接下来当局将会扩展现有的医疗设施。此次扩展不仅包括扩展现有医疗系统的数量并提高质量，而且还将涉及小规模的国有化与公私合建。此举在提高民众对政府支持率的同时，也能让人们更快恢复健康，从而参与工作，回到经济与社会复苏的一线去。"
 IBR_Subsidies_Special_PS:0 "公共服务专项补贴"
 IBR_ps_subsidies_tt:0 "我们会为公共服务发放专项补贴，保证一部分人的工作机会。"
 IBR_Subsidies_Special_PS_desc:0 "我们的医疗保健计划得到了民众的支持，这意味着我们可以更放心地推进更多的政府干预项目。新经济计划的下一步是为雇用超过1200名员工的公共服务部门提供专项补贴。\n\n引入这些补贴能避免我们的公共服务部门自行崩溃从而大规模裁员。我们首先会在公共部门试行项目，如果成功，我们最终也会将其推广到私营部门。"
 IBR_Progressive_Tax_System:0 "累进税制"
 IBR_progressive_taxes_tt:0 "“那些挣得多的应该比挣得少的出更多的力。”"
 IBR_Progressive_Tax_System_desc:0 "虽然目前为止我们的危机政策都很受欢迎，但似乎也有越来越多的人认为我们没有足够的资金维持这些政策。作为回应，我们提议全面修改税法，用累进制取代我们目前的固定所得税制度，对高收入者征收的税率将高于低收入者。虽然这在低收入群体和左翼人士中会很受欢迎，但也可以预料到高收入群体和自由市场支持者将会强烈反对，不过这都是抵御风暴的必须措施。"
 IBR_Tame_Inflation:0 "抑制通货膨胀"
 IBR_tame_inflation_tt:0 "我们会尝试控制通货膨胀。"
 IBR_Tame_Inflation_desc:0 "危机之后的通货膨胀一直在飙升，如果我们再不做点什么它就要失控了。好消息是我们的新经济计划包含了控制通货膨胀的政策，现在是引入这些政策的最好时机。我们将提高利率，鼓励储蓄以减缓物价上涨。除此之外我们还会实施临时工资控制，保持物价和工资稳定降低。虽然支持我们之前政策的人会很不喜欢这一系列措施，但至少能让工业家们冷静一下。"
 IBR_New_Energy_Investments:0 "投资新能源"
 IBR_New_Energy_Investments_desc:0 "虽然我们在减少石油消耗方面取得了一些进展，但我们一定要保证这样的危机不会再次发生，因此我们必须寻找新能源。我们主要可以利用的可再生能源是风力和水力，所以，我们计划在贯穿西班牙和葡萄牙的泰格斯河上修建一座大坝，作为我国新能源计划的一部分。同时，由于修筑水坝需要一些时间，我们还将在半岛北部投资建设风力发电厂。\n\n尽管耗资不菲，但将能源大权握于手中可以让下一次中东危机爆发时我们不会束手无策。"
 IBR_energy_investments_tt:0 "投资新能源将花费我们§Y15M$§!，给我们带来§Y2£tt_power 电力§!。"
 IBR_Worldwide_Trading:0 "全球贸易"
 IBR_Worldwide_Trading_desc:0 "石油危机是一场全球性危机，任何与全球经济相关的经济体都会不可避免地受到影响。然而，尽管如此，我们还是得寻找新的贸易伙伴来实现贸易多样化。如此，即便我们的某个贸易伙伴因未来的全球经济衰退而崩溃，我们至少还有其他伙伴可以依靠。\n\n此外，通过与世界建立更多的贸易联系，可以加快我们国家的经济复苏。我们还可以接触更广泛的市场和更多的外国投资机会。"
 IBR_Pay_Our_Debts:0 "准备偿还债务"
 IBR_pay_our_debts_tt:0 "政府会开始偿还债务，以稳定债权人的信心！"
 IBR_Pay_Our_Debts_desc:0 "目前我们已经实施了新经济计划的大部分内容，是时候开始偿还我们在资助经济复苏计划期间所累积的债务了。我们必须尽快偿还，以免出现债务违约。\n\n此外，通过偿还贷款，我们可以增加商界的信心，使得我们在未来需要时能够继续贷款。政府偿还贷款的能力对于确保我们的经济复苏能否完成至关重要。"
 IBR_Another_Economic_Miracle:0 "“奇迹的二次到来”"
 IBR_Another_Economic_Miracle_desc:0 "自危机开始以来，很少有听到过好消息。但我们的内部经济学家预测，伊比利亚的复苏应该很快就会到来。虽然这非常出色，但我们还不能自满，我们得坚持之前制定的紧急措施，并继续前进，否则就会面临经济衰退的风险。新经济计划已经基本实施，眼下，坚持目前的措施似乎是通往复苏的捷径，我们的经济学家也同意这一点。"
 IBR_End_Crisis_UR:0 "结束危机"
 IBR_end_crisis_tt:0 "危机已经过去，但我们还有许多工作要做…"
 IBR_End_Crisis_UR_desc:0 "事情已然明了，萧条的最坏阶段已经结束，我们终于能爬出深渊，休养生息。这意味着我们能够放松一些在危机开始时颁布的紧急措施，伊比利亚的事态也能恢复正常。我们所希冀的更光明、更公平的伊比利亚将很快成为现实，而新经济计划也会扩展并适应脱离危机的经济。但在此之前，我们会确保每个伊比利亚人，无论他们的生活状况如何，都会相信政府能保障他们的福祉。"
 IBR_marketlib_victory:0 "民主革新党胜利"
 IBR_marketlib_victory_desc:0 "伊比利亚的人民厌倦了考迪罗对经济困境无休止的不作为，选择改善经济作为首次国会选举中的优先议题。我们的民主革新党如今获得了安定多数席位。终于，人们对比塞塔的信心开始上升，外国的投资者也叩着我们的门，想知道我们的经济改革能为国家带来些什么。"
 IBR_embrace_capitalism:0 "拥抱资本主义"
 IBR_embrace_capitalism_desc:0 "自然，当下的首要任务是彻底扫除考迪罗的自给自足观念，全心全意地拥抱那运转得足够良好，以让所谓“堕落”的西方富足起来的资本主义自由市场体系。事实证明，坚持自给自足长期来看只能带来灾难，还给外国对我国经济的信心造成了沉重打击。不过，再也没有比经济自由更好的药方了，想必用不了多久，我们便能弥补考迪罗对我国的损害。"
 IBR_promote_trade_schools:0 "建立财经大学"
 IBR_promote_trade_schools_desc:0 "由于有整整一代人在自给自足的经济下长大，我们的大学里新培养出的这批经济学家和企业家明显缺乏专业的经济知识。我们有必要建立专门机构，推出弥补不足的继续教育，以确保经济学的从业者不会半瓶水晃荡。要是不这么做，我们相比经济上的竞争对手就会有灾难性的缺点了。"
 IBR_less_economic_restrictions:0 "放宽经济的限制"
 IBR_less_economic_restrictions_desc:0 "真令人吃惊，即便是最基础的财务工作也有大量的问题与繁文缛节。真想知道考迪罗当初起草立法的时候到底是怎么想的，对以往的每项相关政策都单独进行评估只是空耗时间与资源，还不如我们自己立个对现状更有帮助的法律。我们需要一种刀耕火种的开拓，而市场将会在恰当的时候解决所有这些政策带来的影响。"
 IBR_privatise_government_assets:0 "私有化政府财产"
 IBR_privatise_government_assets_desc:0 "国有制度扼杀了创新，吓跑了外国投资人。让没有经过专业培训的政府官僚直接监督如此巨量的经济资产实在是太没意义了，尤其是当不乏技术高超且心肠及热的企业界们咬牙切齿地愿意承担这些重要资产时。出售这些资产不仅可以证明我们忠于自由市场，而且也能让官僚们腾出手来完成更重要的任务，同时还可以在未来给政府提供健康的资金收入。"
 IBR_new_tax_plans:0 "改革税制"
 IBR_new_tax_plans_desc:0 "大企业赋70%的税？小企业赋50%的税？荒谬！如果一开始几乎没人申请，如此高的赋税又有什么意义？只有军事头脑的佛朗哥显然没有受过经济学教育，而萨拉查也没有过问这件事。尽管如此，减税和税制合理化是永不嫌迟的。再多的繁文缛节也阻止不了民营企业发展的锋芒！"
 IBR_expand_market_sectors:0 "重振市场"
 IBR_expand_market_sectors_desc:0 "虽说我国经济总体而言都不怎么样，但其中有几个市场领域的状况尤其糟糕。我们的农业尽管占了经济的大头，在方法和管理上仍很落后。对农民的补贴、对投资者的激励以及朝着完成机械化的努力，仅仅只是让我们与乌克兰的强大农业同台竞技的门票。此外，我国主要制造商的私有化能最终让早该达成的工业机械与技术的现代化成为现实。"
 IBR_a_nation_of_opportunity:0 "机会之国"
 IBR_a_nation_of_opportunity_desc:0 "两个世纪以来，美国一直能自称为“机遇之地”。然而，虽说我国的历史要比他们不知长上多少个世纪，我们从来都不敢说自己有哪方面比得上他们在自由与繁荣的进步，即使是在统一之后。也就是靠着掠夺新大陆，西班牙才能成为首个全球霸主！考迪罗的自给自足和德国的奴隶经济都是走不通的死胡同。相反，赢家是世界上的自由国家，这恰恰说明努力工作、聪明才智和经济自发性才是伊比利亚繁荣富强的关键。只要努力奋斗，每个伊比利亚人都可能是下一个福特或洛克菲勒！"
 IBR_Work_of_God:0 "上帝的杰作"
 IBR_Work_of_God_desc:0 "法西斯主义者、马克思主义者和佛朗哥主义者都说我们疯了，但谁笑到最后了呢？经济高速增长，外国资金涌入，连普通人也被西-葡黄金时代以来从未有过的乐观情绪鼓舞！教会原先警惕我们的“财阀意图”，如今也转而接受我们的思维，并完全支持我们振兴伊比利亚的努力。那些困在十九世纪的落后思想家呼声渐低，被群众庆祝成功的欢呼声完全淹没，就连旧政权的拥护者也表示感谢和祝贺！当德国人还在奴隶制和大萧条的泥潭中艰难爬行时，我们，曾经的欧洲笑柄，如今在世界的舞台上愈飞愈高！伊比利亚万岁！"
 IBR_marklib_responsible_democracy:0 "负责任的民主"
 IBR_marklib_responsible_democracy_desc:0 "将民主赋予未能理解其内涵与追求目标的愚民，也许并非是一件好事。选民在未接受对民主意识的教育前，他们根本不知投票所代表的意义！我们应该资助一些教育项目，让现在这帮年轻人记住第二共和国的教训，同时也让那群老古董接受对旧制度的改变。此外，更应该下放教育基金到公立与私立的学校，开设宪法教育课堂，如此以往，无论是富裕的资产阶级后代还是贫穷农民的孩子，都能理解现如今的制度，并且在社会中找到属于自己的地位。"
 IBR_freedom_of_speech:0 "放宽演讲限制"
 IBR_freedom_of_speech_desc:0 "语言到底有何种魔力？在现实与经济面前，语言不过是过往云烟，完全不需要对其过多提防。减少对言论自由与新闻自由的限制对当局无关痛痒，我们的政策和政策带来的繁荣会证明一切，远胜所有的批评者。让赤色分子和反动派嚷嚷去吧，满满当当的钱包发出的声音会比他们更响亮！"
 IBR_more_voting_booths:0 "更多投票点"
 IBR_more_voting_booths_desc:0 "尽管选举委员会展现出了一切诚意，但赋予我们权力的选举却不一定代表全体人民。当然不必求全责备，现在已经有足够多的人投给我们了。但仍有部分地区的农村与城市没有得到与北部、东部与中部的核心地带同等的关注，特别是安达卢西亚、加利西亚和埃斯特雷马杜拉这些地方。好消息是，只要提供资金增加投票站与选举监督员的数量，我们就能让选举覆盖全国的每一座城市，到时每个人都会为选举投票。"
 IBR_regional_elections:0 "举行地方选举"
 IBR_regional_elections_desc:0 "仅仅在联邦层面上选举中央政府是远远不够的，这种投票方式既不能满足选民的要求，也不能改换不受欢迎的地方政府。地方选举，包括选举市长、地方议会等，对于我们全新的自由民主制度来说地方选举就和其他所有的民主理念一样重要。而普通人更能借此看到民主在各级政府中的作用，才不会对我们的制度信心，转而重新依靠暴力解决问题。"
 IBR_Catholic_Guidance:0 "天主教指引我们"
 IBR_Catholic_Guidance_desc:0 "虽然我们党和教会在过去有些矛盾，但我们要让他们知道，我们与他们之间存在的所有问题都只与他们在旧政府中扮演的角色有关。但当涉及到社会问题与道德问题时，我们很乐意同神职人员和梵蒂冈携手合作。他们的支持不仅有助于巩固保守派对当局的信心，更有可能让保守派转而支持我们的政策，而我们也不会放弃从保守派中搜寻人才的机会。"
 IBR_change_with_the_times:0 "我们与时俱进…"
 IBR_change_with_the_times_desc:0 "佛朗哥也许在某些地方做的太过了，我们能够理解他的意图，毕竟分离主义是心腹大患，但一个属于和平与宽容的新纪元已经到来了。让巴斯克人和加泰罗尼亚人恢复他们自己的语言与传统吧。在暴政与压迫下并不能获得任何经济利益，长久处于动荡的地区只会让我们得不偿失，我们当然不会想因为一些小小的语言与传统节日问题，影响到即将到来的经济鹏飞。"
 IBR_Some_lines_should_not_be_crossed:0 "…但不可逾越界限"
 IBR_Some_lines_should_not_be_crossed_desc:0 "虽然我们已经接受了经济进步主义，但社会进步主义又完全是另外一回事。我们当然是一个真正的伊比利亚政党，一个真正的天主教政党，但并不是所有的伊比利亚人都像我们一样践行天主教的价值观，粗暴地忽略他们的呼声或是假装我们并没有身处一个全球化的社会中完全就是自欺欺人。离婚问题正是这么一个困扰伊比利亚与我党关系的问题，大多人认为传统家庭是凝聚社会的重要组成部分。我们必须慎重对待这个问题，决定是要接受一定程度的世俗主义允许离婚，还是继续坚定不移地奉行天主教原则。而两种选择都不会让所有人满意。"
 IBR_Harmonious_Society:0 "为了和谐社会"
 IBR_Harmonious_Society_desc:0 "上帝、祖国和家庭都是不错的社会基石，可空有基石可没法造出房子。教会也许是我们的立身之本，但没有资本主义与自由，就没有今天的我们与伊比利亚。天主教或许能让每个基督徒都视彼此为弟兄，但经济与个体自由才让每个基督徒能享受生活、发展事业，而非铐着名为自给自足的枷锁劳动。碌碌众生的平凡劳动是通向圣洁的要途，因而必使得他有自由以善己身。伊比利亚社会会因人民繁荣而圣洁从而无比和谐。"
 IBR_tackle_government_incompetence:0 "解决政府的无能"
 IBR_tackle_government_incompetence_desc:0 "伊比利亚的现任政府就和它的前任政府一样以无能出名。考迪罗们一点补救措施都没做，只是把他们的忠犬和他们认为“可靠”的人堆在一起组建了这么个畸形东西。该大洗牌了，我们会解雇所有没能力不合格的官员，招聘新人来取代他们的位置，让我们的国家机器运行起来有效率一些。"
 IBR_marklib_government_training:0 "新政府培训项目"
 IBR_marklib_government_training_desc:0 "即使清除了那些尸位素餐之徒，但仍有不少人对他们要做什么没有一个清晰的概念。也许对这个体制来说太晚了，但对于他们来说刚刚好。严格而公平的培训计划将从谷壳中筛出小麦，只留下真正适合在政府工作的人。虽然我们也希望能简单地剔除所有不是百分百合格的人，但这么做只会让潜在的人才全部被赶光。"
 IBR_restructure_federal_agencies:0 "重组联邦机构"
 IBR_restructure_federal_agencies_desc:0 "伊比利亚的种种困境大多是时候都能完全归咎于我们臃肿低效的官僚机构。成百上千的雇员甚至机构在吃空饷，他们什么都不干但每年总在想方设法地吞掉数百万比塞塔的资金。很显然我们会裁掉这些人，但这也会在体制中留下权力真空。为此我们将扩张其他机构，合并旧有的机构职责，从而大大减少雇员人数，理顺我们那个和迷宫样的官僚体系。"
 IBR_marklib_anti_corruption_measures:0 "反腐败措施"
 IBR_marklib_anti_corruption_measures_desc:0 "腐败简直就是专制肚子里的蛔虫。一个独裁者雇用他的朋友，他的朋友又雇用他自己的两个朋友，如此往复，直到整个体系都是唯唯诺诺的应声虫。不过好在我们上台的时候伊比利亚的政府还没走到这个地步，甚至有很多时间可以用来清理政府内各部门。首先要解决的是任人唯亲的问题，但似乎有些部门也有大量资金不翼而飞了……"
 IBR_judicial_reform_70:0 "司法改革"
 IBR_judicial_reform_70_desc:0 "你没法在别的地方找到比在伊比利亚的上下法院中找到更多的保守派法西斯了。即便是军队也没被考迪罗像控制我国司法那样控制得那么深。那些对司法不公负有责任的人将被终身取消职业资格，并在必要时接受审判。取而代之的是忠于新政权的人，现在法律制度将有利于受过高等教育的人。最最重要的是，司法机构的成员必须具有高尚的道德品质，能够在仅仅是一个解释就能决定一个国家的命运时做出正确的决断。"
 IBR_marlib_final_step:0 "劳动果实"
 IBR_marlib_final_step_desc:0 "几个世纪以来，街上的人第一次可以说：“是的，我对我们的经济和政府很有信心！”尽管考迪罗们权势滔天，但他们从来没有达到过这一成就。看看我们做的事有多么伟大吧：普通工人，无论他是蓝领还是白领，都能享受远超温饱水平的工资，而这之中完全没有公会的插手和失败的自给自足运动。这是第一次，他们可以相信伊比利亚在真正有能力的领导人手中是安全的，他们也愿意让这个体制成为对所有人都有好处的体制。虽然还不知道接下来会如何发展，但我们相信上帝青睐伊比利亚。"

 IBR_Opus_Dei_Program_desc:0 "有人争论说，在当前的危急形势下，有必要对市场进行某种形式的干预，即便是我们内部的官员也被这种蠢话搞得动摇了。幸运的是，主业会旗下的忠诚机构已经提供了一个全面的计划，以让我们从黑暗中复苏。\n\n这个组织承诺，只需施加一些刺激，市场就能恢复运转并重回正轨。不过总的来说，这个应急计划的目的是在缓解危机的同时维护市场自由主义的意识形态，毕竟历史已经证明了市场永远是统筹资源最高效的措施。主业会许诺，他们将向投资者们开放开采新能源的机会，同时推行全面的减税措施，最终达成供应商的复兴，以满足旺盛的需求。在此之前，应该允许市场自己稳定下来。"
 IBR_Earn_Your_Wage:0 "工作换得工资"
 IBR_Earn_Your_Wage_desc:0 "由于石油危机愈演愈烈，有相当多的请愿书送到了政府官员的桌子上。而里面最让人不安的一份，则抱怨了巴塞罗那的一家工厂为了维持资产流动性便不公平地开除了大部分员工。这种事完全无法让人接受。我们绝不能让公司破产，也绝不能摧毁我们赖以走出危机的市场力量。\n\n为了解决这个问题，有人提议引入一种新的工作文化，有了它我们就能确保公司能维持所需的员工数量，同时又不需要用未满足的可变成本来付出代价。因此，我们需要保证公司知道只要它们能留住那些真才实干的人，政府就会支持它们解雇不必要的员工。长远来看，这种做法也可以提高生产效率。"
 IBR_Audit_SegSoc:0 "审视社保局"
 IBR_Audit_SegSoc_desc:0 "关于重塑经济的讨论很难绕开社会保障体系的管理责任。毫无疑问，它是现代国家组织的重要成分，但这不代表它不会长出名为“低效”的顽疾。关于社保的批评大多指责它投入的金钱难以回流到经济循环中，就像一个无底洞。该重新审视这个系统了，里头肯定有因为经营不善导致的无效支出。裁掉它们，省下的钱刺激一下这一潭死水的经济吧。"
 IBR_Oil_For_Pay:0 "石油…只给那些买得起的"
 IBR_Oil_For_Pay_desc:0 "在持续的石油危机中，许多政府都选择了采取直接干预的手段，以减少石油消费并降低国营石油的价格。但我们不会严厉的控制来损害经济。自由市场已经无数次证明了，供需关系才是分配资源的最有效方式。因此，我们应该利用市场这只看不见的手来分配我们的石油，以消费者愿意承担的价格为标准，确保石油最终会流向那些真正需要的人。"
 IBR_Invest_Energy:0 "投资新能源"
 IBR_Invest_Energy_desc:0 "眼下的危机揭示了一个紧要问题，石油不能再被当作众多经济部门的唯一能源。能源多样性的缺乏，让再小规模的冲击都有可能造成难以估量的损失。因此，我们必须开发其他的可替代能源，以确保在其他人都陷入窘境时，我们仍能屹立不倒。在对我们现有的方案做过考察后，水力发电脱颖而出。我们有必要迅速采取措施以恢复市场信心。"

 IBR_Let_Market_Alone:0 "让市场自己解决"
 IBR_Let_Market_Alone_desc:0 "有些官员和压力团体气势汹汹地来到政府，认为直接干预纠正市场才是让伊比利亚走出危机的正确方法。在经过一番激烈的辩论之后，他们终于艰难地接受了一个现实：显然他们陷入了不理智的恐慌之中！难道他们不知道市场是有规律的吗？难道他们不知道市场是最好也同样是唯一的自我修正工具吗？当中央为了实现所谓的良好变革而一次又一次地干预时，往往都会出现可怕的结果。从另一方面看，市场有强大的自我纠正、稳定供需的能力。我们必须再次相信市场，它会带我们走出危机，走向昌盛。"
 IBR_Find_New_Markets_ML:0 "开辟新的市场"
 IBR_Find_New_Markets_ML_desc:0 "鉴于前任政府的斑斑劣迹，当前政府一直以增进内部市场自由化为己任。但随着石油危机的到来，我们不得不调转矛头，将我们的市场自由化愿景扩展到国际上。和能源多样化一样，我们也得让我们的贸易线路多边化。我们贸易线路的单调性和突如其来的市场重组给了我们单薄的经济沉重一击，因此我们需要寻找更多的外部市场，增强我们的贸易能力，避免未来可能发生的相关危机。"
 IBR_Find_New_Markets_ML_tt:0 "我们同许多国家的贸易关系将被提升。"
 IBR_Tax_Cut_Oil_Crisis:0 "全面减税"
 IBR_Tax_Cut_Oil_Crisis_desc:0 "石油危机严重影响了当局的财政与国家安全，内部市场的经济衰退在此之中扮演着重要角色。从大小公司到平头百姓，他们的钱包都干干瘪瘪，难以进行投资和消费，这无疑是对经济的沉重打击。政府不应该解决人与市场的交互问题，而是应该解决市场的运作问题，当然我们会为市场提供机会，刺激活力。为此，我们决定全面减税，这将影响经济的方方面面，公众有钱之后，我们将会看到一个崭新的日常再度回归。"
 IBR_Allow_Private_Services:0 "允许私人公共服务"
 IBR_Allow_Private_Services_desc:0 "尽管我们穷尽一切办法，试图让伊比利亚的公众接受自由市场资本主义，但却从未能在基础公共服务这座壁垒上凿开一个口子。但这场危机给我们提供了动力，让我们取得了对那些阻碍经济自由化的人的全面胜利。在恢复政府财政支出稳定性的幌子下，允许私人提供公共服务的决定得到了批准。对于有能力负担私人服务花费的人来说，我们仍为这些社会中的弱势群体提供了一层安全网。根据现有的法律，这项措施会受到很长一段时间的审查，许多人仍不完全信任这一举措，但我们相信，市场展现出的高效将使他们放下心来。"
 IBR_Negotiate_Creditors:0 "与债权人协商"
 IBR_Negotiate_Creditors_desc:0 "新生的伊比利亚联盟从其诞生的第一天起就不得不花大价钱在一个动荡的欧洲中勉力维持着周遭的安全和内部的稳定，政府因此背上了沉重的债务。现在债主们认识到了国际经济实在是没动力了，一部分人坚持要我们立即偿还贷款，甚至允许降低利率。无论如何，还完这些成年累月攒下来的债肯定会妨碍国家经济的恢复，所以我们务必和债主们达成共识，让他们明白，延期还款对双方都更加有益。"
 IBR_Thank_Later:0 "“日后你们会感激我们的。”"
 IBR_Thank_Later_desc:0 "根据主业会的要求，以及政府所明确批准实施的经济措施，通过各方面的反馈证明了其成功。但是这也得罪了一部分利益集团与广大民众，他们愤怒的宣称这些改革是极其的不人道且冷血，到处都能见到抗议的人群，反对政府的人空前之多。显然，当只依靠技术官僚政府的主意时，很难让多数民众理解并服从。一些必要的舍弃与牺牲可能被视为政府的不作为，更糟糕的则是会被认为是政府有意的作恶。但是，像在过去的历史中的许多事一样，这是弊在当代功在千秋的事情。假以时日，民众必然会感谢我们所做的一切。我们选择的道路既正义又正确。"
 IBR_Crutial_Moment:0 "历史性的关键时刻"
 IBR_Crutial_Moment_desc:0 "历史的十字路口在我们脚下。伊比利亚必须做出选择：接受，然后积极配合我们的改革；或者抵制，否认改革的价值，然后和其他被经济危机击垮的国家一同陨落。仅凭对市场各股力量的有效约束，伊比利亚联盟便有潜力超越其他与本国国情相似的国家、成为领先全欧洲的强国。现今我们已经倾尽所能，我们的应对措施经过了精心筹划，这使得通过必要的立法来应对危机成为可能。因此，经济腾飞的基础已经筑牢。现在，轮到伊比利亚人民做出决断了：引领国家走向繁荣，或拒绝我们的馈赠。"
 IBR_conservative_victory:0 "人民联盟胜利"
 IBR_conservative_victory_desc:0 "随着民主重归伊比利亚，人民终于得以重新发声。而我们，人民联盟，也已经成功在伊比利亚议会中取得了多数席位。群众已经发出呼吁：秩序、正义和良善的基督教道德应是当今的主流。这无疑是明智之举，而我们亦将不遗余力地去实现。"
 IBR_Moral_Nation:0 "道德之国"
 IBR_Moral_Nation_desc:0 "社会、国家以及个人的优良品德，对于任何像我们这般优秀的天主教国家来说都是重要的。数十年前，不敬神的革命者们尝试着去推翻我们伟大国家的每一道公序良俗，致使巴塞罗那的大街上声色犬马，到处都是酒鬼和妓女。倘若没有考迪罗和教会的规训，这些浪荡的家伙会把他们的卑鄙恶行散播到伊比利亚的每个角落！这便是世俗化的下场，也是人民阵线和他们狂热的伙伴们孜孜以求的所谓的“解放”的本质。在我们的时刻注视下，他们的恶行不会在我们的国家有一块立足之地。同时，我们需要对国民施以正确的教导，从而确保如今的道德之国会在未来数代当中得以留存。"

 IBR_Freedom_Nation_desc:0 "集会自由、言论自由、批评自由、抗议自由……这些都是我们可以做出的让步。当批评的声音完全消失（又或者至少是被压低）时，统治当然是一件比较容易的事情。可是我们必须接受：恢复审查制度以及在民间对相对无害的政治因素进行镇压只会损害新当选政府的公信力。尽管民主有其困境，可相比起那些严厉佛朗哥主义守旧派，或许那些声称民主制度是“最不糟糕的政府制度”的人们更值得被倾听。"
 IBR_Patriotic_Education:0 "爱国教育"
 IBR_Patriotic_Education_desc:0 "毫无疑问，共产党人、无政府主义者和工团主义者们在内战期间犯下的最严重的罪行之一就是他们试图完全破坏西班牙本身的民族认同！葡萄牙人应当庆幸他们没有遭遇过此等横祸。显然，这些危险思想之所以能够生根，全赖如洪水猛兽般的现代生活造就的现代思想的脆弱以及那如野火一般针对大众的拙劣教育的快速普及。一些思想开放的人可能会抱怨我们的新教育计划的枯燥和讲话，可是在我们的年轻一代中宣扬强烈的民族意识对确保伊比利亚作为一座万众一心的自由国度的长治久安至关重要。"
 IBR_Library_Expansion:0 "扩建图书馆"
 IBR_Library_Expansion_desc:0 "常言道，书籍是世界之光。即便没什么典籍可以比肩《圣经》，可世上也不乏一些能够教育当世启迪未来的宏篇巨作（尽管它们属于别的范畴）。当我们投入更多经费、支持扫盲运动并资助新兴作家来鼓励扩充公共图书馆时，我们便不会如那帮子纳粹一样被后世唾骂为焚书坑儒的疯子了。尽管我们党内那些比较……老派的成员会对有关于那些异见或是，上帝保佑，马克思主义相关的言论流入年轻人当中略有微词，可我们都相信通过正确的教育民众会把这些罔言扫进历史的垃圾堆里的。"
 IBR_library_expansion_tt:0 "我们会在全国范围内建设新的图书馆。"
 IBR_More_Sport_Less_Latin:0 "多运动，少拉丁"
 IBR_More_Sport_Less_Latin_desc:0 "古典教育固然是很好的，可就传统而言，我们注重拉丁语并将之设为所有学生的必修课可能有些过分了。毕竟，如果一个真正的伊比利亚男子汉，更别说是一位伊比利亚绅士，在年轻时埋头于凯撒和西塞罗的著作，他能够从中汲取力量成为一个孝顺的儿子、温柔的丈夫和可靠的父亲吗？过去的经典也许会启迪他的思想使他怀古思今，可每一位伊比利亚的好男儿都应当是雷厉风行的男子汉！诚然，我们不会抛弃我们那古老的语言本源，可那些要在未来继承我们衣钵的孩子们一定要身强体壮，坚韧不拔，如此我们才能放心将国家的重担托付给他们。"
 IBR_Cultural_Diversity_Protection:0 "保护文化多样性"
 IBR_Cultural_Diversity_Protection_desc:0 "归根结底，伊比利亚是一个由多个成员国组成的联邦，而非是什么压迫自己人民的贪得无厌的超级大国。这一点甚至可以上溯至伊莎贝拉女王和费迪南国王的伊比利亚大婚之时。也许佛朗哥在内战时就巴斯克人和加泰罗尼亚人争取自治之事进行弹压是正确之举，可如今时过境迁。上帝并没有让卡斯蒂利亚人、莱昂人或是葡萄牙人去各扫门前雪，而是让我们作为一个整体平等共处。随着政治形势不再需要佛朗哥的那些严刑峻法，我们可以着眼于弥合我国主体民族与少数民族之间的分歧，并确保我国的民族兄弟情能够顶住未来的各种磨难。"
 IBR_Rural_Roots:0 "尊重农村之本"
 IBR_Rural_Roots_desc:0 "我们的经济已今非昔比，农村人口占多数的时代早已过去，可这是否意味着我们应该去轻易接受美国佬或者是德国佬所沉迷的物欲横流的城市风尚吗？答案自然是否定的！即便如今经济形势表明城市和工厂是未来的实际发展方向，伊比利亚的灵魂根植于她广袤的乡村。在乡村生活当中，农民在地主和堂区负责任的管理和引导之下在田地里辛勤耕作，我们从中会找到一种更简单更幸福的生活。这样的生活正是我们伊比利亚人所推崇的：在我们历史绝大多数时间当中的平和且可敬的生活。"
 IBR_Iberia_Forever:0 "伊比利亚恒久远"
 IBR_Iberia_Forever_desc:0 "虽然听上去很奇怪，可在如今这动荡年代，我们迎来了一个新的传统，那便是伊比利亚本身。最初，伊比利亚仅仅是出于现实考量而创建的。可如今她却完全代表了一种完全不同的事物：一个伟大而多元的民族——伊比利亚人。在为部落冲突、豪强并起还有百家争鸣所分裂了千年之后，伊比利亚终于迎来了她的统一。从安达卢西亚的广阔平原到纳瓦拉的巍峨山峰，从风景如画的里斯本旖旎海滨到昼夜不息的加泰罗尼亚工业小镇，我们的力量和情谊从未如此这般坚实过。那些孕育了我们的地方将会继续繁荣，然而我们将不会再打着地方的旗号去敌视来自不同地区的同胞。我们都来自伊比利亚，我们将永远是她的孩子。"

 IBR_Dawn_New_Era_desc:0 "当我党依靠着经济学常识和美好的基督教美德当选时，法西斯分子和马克思主义等一干人等在媒体和街头对我们展开了恶毒的攻讦，他们嘲笑我们对这些原则的奉献都是痴人说梦。如今，他们一句话也说不出来，如果他们胆敢开口就会立马找来一片嘘声。这并非我们所为，我们永远不会参与进政治激辩当中，相反，我们从民众当中发掘的无数忠实支持者们的杰作。我们还能有幸接受什么更加明确的执政授权呢？依靠着民众和天主教会的支持，伊比利亚已经开始挑战那自无敌舰队和日不落帝国时代以来都难以启及的辉煌了！我们在短期内靠着一套民主制度完成了两位考迪罗近二十年联合独裁统治所没有完成的事业！伊比利亚迎来了一个新时代：一个和平、繁荣，以及，最重要的，稳定的时代！对我们这代人来说，这是留给未来数代的伊比利亚人最好的礼物。上帝保佑伊比利亚！"

 IBR_Political_Parties_Registry:0 "政党登记"
 IBR_Political_Parties_Registry_desc:0 "在内战之前，左右两派的许多社团在本质上都是非官方的民间组织。更能体现出这一性质的是激进左派，他们通常以工会、工人民兵和村庄公社的形式组织起来。如今，所有的政治社团都会注册成为正式政党。这是很常见的事情，因为这样人们能更清楚明白哪种政党所代表着哪种立场与主义。"
 IBR_Demilitarize_Police:0 "警察去军事化"
 IBR_Demilitarize_Police_desc:0 "在内战期间，西班牙本土军队不是叛徒遍地就是滑稽可笑，唯独非洲军团证明了他们都是贞良死节之士。有鉴于此，佛朗哥大刀阔斧地扩大警察规模和职权，用来维系大战后西班牙的公共秩序。一整支武装到牙齿的巡逻队自然会让任何赤匪感到恐惧，可要养这么一支武装的成本也可想而知，而且在执行任务时容易打草惊蛇。随着动乱平息，各大独立运动偃旗息鼓，这样子一支臃肿的部队似乎不再有什么必要了。另外，我们相信：从长远来看，推翻两位佛朗哥和萨拉查两位考迪罗的改革并不会给我们带来什么不必要的问题。"
 IBR_Regional_Question_AP:0 "地区分离主义问题"
 IBR_Regional_Question_AP_desc:0 "很不幸地是，即便在佛朗哥长期弹压之下，地方分离主义仍旧是一大问题。如果我们不能又快又好地解决这一顽疾，那些可恶的分离主义运动无疑会再度抬头。我们无意继续推行佛朗哥的方针，这些政策实际上实在刺激分离主义者们去负隅顽抗，但同时我们也不能对人民阵线所提出的增加地方自治权的政策让步，这无疑会让伊比利亚分崩离析再度陷入灾难当中。这一问题必须在议会和内阁提上日程了。或许我们向各地方团体发出沟通信号也是一步妙棋？"
 IBR_Token_Autonomy:0 "象征性自治"
 IBR_Token_Autonomy_desc:0 "诚然，自治问题已经有所定论。在伊比利亚不会再有什么“国中之国”了。虽然我们也能够理解地方主义者们的诉求，可他们也必须要去学会接受伊比利亚议会的现实。如果完全实现法律平等对其他人来说已经足够好了，那对他们来说也没差。我们不会再在地方自治问题上做出让步，尽管我们会让渡一些微小的权利。也许是让他们有权制订自己的公共假日，又或是其他的与特定文化相关的问题？"
 IBR_Axencia_Expansion:0 "扩张反分裂局"
 IBR_Axencia_Expansion_desc:0 "创建反分裂局一定是两位考迪罗针对国内安全问题所制订出的最明智的一项政策。通过在警察和军队所无法运作的领域上开展工作，反分裂局是国家的剑和盾，更是伊比利亚人民的剑和盾。由于该组织显然并未阻碍联邦的民主进程，我们因此坚信反分裂局将国家安危而非争权夺利摆在第一位。有鉴于他们多年来为伊比利亚鞠躬尽瘁，特别是在我们国家转型的过程当中警察的职能正在减少，扩张反分裂局并拨出更多的资金势在必行。"

 IBR_Supervised_Democracy:0 "监督选举"
 IBR_Supervised_Democracy_desc:0 "对我们这个刚结束独裁统治的国家来说，保护我们的选举程序是我们面对的一大难题。无论是长枪党忠实拥趸、法西斯主义者，抑或是马克思主义者都虎视眈眈企图颠覆我们的民主进程。尽管我们采取了一些措施，并启用了不记名投票制度，可这些都还不够。选举监督员将确保不会出现选举舞弊现象，而新一批官僚队伍则会保证选举名单整洁有序。如果未来的伊比利亚式民主想要感谢我们什么，那一定是我们无惧程序本身会对我党利益带来多大不便也要恪守公平原则和对自由民主价值的诚挚奉献。"
 IBR_Mistakes_Were_Made:0 "大错已然铸成"
 IBR_Mistakes_Were_Made_desc:0 "在如今，批评两位考迪罗有时会矫枉过正也并不是什么冒犯的言论了。毫无疑问的是，尽管佛朗哥和萨拉查永远将伊比利亚的利益放在第一位，每个人都知道他们所说的“为了大义要不择手段”是什么意思。尽管我们会有点对不起他们过去的兢兢业业，可我们绝对不能够沉湎于过去，进而对他们过去的所作所为粉饰太平！虽然说没人需要去了解过去那些血腥的细节，但是让大众了解并接受考迪罗统治时期的残酷现实是我们同选民之间建立信任的关键的第一步。更别说在我们党内还有大量服务于前政权的工作人员。"
 IBR_Rewrite_Penal_Code:0 "重写刑法典"
 IBR_Rewrite_Penal_Code_desc:0 "在两位考迪罗治下，采取严刑酷法是时不时会发生的事情。尽管我们承认反分裂局的强硬手段是必要之恶，可司法机构本不应在广大百姓当中有着酷吏的恶名。特别是在工人阶级当中，无论我们做出什么承诺，他们始终都对我们抱有戒心。有鉴于法官和检察官们大多对两位考迪罗抱有强烈的同情，我们所能想到的最谨慎的做法就是重修我国的刑法典并适当地引入司法监督体系。"
 IBR_Franco_was_Franco:0 "佛朗哥就是佛朗哥"
 IBR_Franco_was_Franco_desc:0 "正如我们一再正告我党的批评者的那样：没错，我们从没忘记佛朗哥在内战前后所做的一切！难道我们要因为他那些有违现代人感受的行为而唾弃他吗？答案是不！佛朗哥逐步放开严刑峻法并成功恢复民主制度已经证明了他并非是那个波希米亚下士（指希特勒，该称呼源自兴登堡，其中波希米亚可能是对希特勒出生地布劳瑙所在地的混淆，也可能是作为形容词表示放荡不羁）的法西斯帮凶。相反，佛朗哥是个高度务实的人，他为了自己深爱的祖国和人民可以不惜一切。佛朗哥只会去对真正危及西班牙稳定的敌人重拳出击，面对赤色威胁他的做法无可指摘！佛朗哥是否接受了希特勒和他的乌合之众的帮助？没错，可谁又能够遇见到德国对欧洲的全面征服还有三头同盟最终的灾难性结局？没人应当如此草率地放马后炮并藉此对佛朗哥滥加批评。保护佛朗哥的声誉就是我党的路线，我们也不会对此有哪怕半点后悔。"
 IBR_Renew_Catholicism:0 "更新天主教"
 IBR_Renew_Catholicism_desc:0 "即便是在两位考迪罗的统治时代，日常前往教堂礼拜的人数都要远少于曾经那些更加辉煌的时代。近年来的唯一一次礼拜高峰则是在德国内战时期，人们突然间就意识到自己需要为一些更加紧迫的事情去做祷告了。如果我们无法善用我们新获得的立法权来提醒普罗大众“伊比利亚首先是一个天主教国家”，那我们还算哪门子天主教政党？我们并非是打算强制人们去教堂礼拜，不仅仅是因为这违背了我们的原则，更重要的是这样的举措无法去真正激励信徒。相反，我们应该努力去邀请天主教会在社会建设、福利制度和教育计划当中发挥更大的作用。辅以对新兴宗教建设计划（特别是在加泰罗尼亚这个长期无信仰地区）的健康有序的投资，以及一些针对教会的无可指摘的免税政策，我们应当可以恢复天主教作为伊比利亚地区文化和社会当中的支柱之一的骄傲地位。"
 IBR_Audit_Opus_Dei:0 "调查主业会"
 IBR_Audit_Opus_Dei_desc:0 "尽管主业会的那些国际联系似乎有点可疑，可总的来说这是一个值得信赖的组织。换种说法，主业会对我国的经济影响比我们所预想的要更深远些。虽然我们不会对他们发起刑事调查，这不光毫无道理而且费时费力，可对他们的财务状况和活动情况进行一次审计调查完全合情合理：一次简单的官僚审查就能够确定一切尽在我们掌控之中了。虽然这么做站在政府的角度上是完全合理的，不过进行公开调查的话也许还可以缓解我国的法西斯分子和无神论群体当中的一种常见的担忧，就是我们无法公平地去调查天主教组织。"
 IBR_Role_of_Women:0 "女性的定位"
 IBR_Role_of_Women_desc:0 "尽管女权主义问题于我们而言就像一个潘多拉魔盒，可这个问题我们迟早要解决。虽然西班牙的天主教会十分保守，可信仰天主教的妇女们对早期女权主义予以很大的支持，而女权主义运动已经给那些更加自由开放的国家带来了改变。我党就这一问题分化成了两大阵营。传统派认为基督教有关家庭结构的教义以及相当明确了，因此我们不应冒犯主或是行有违基督教传统之事；革新派则持相反观点，在现代工业经济迅猛发展和国际主义意识抬头的当下，我们真的能够继续恪守妇女只能够扮演传统角色的教条吗？"
 IBR_Modern_Christian_Society:0 "现代基督教社会"
 IBR_Modern_Christian_Society_desc:0 "我们很高兴地宣布，那些嘲笑宗教不过是旧时代的遗物，将我们的信仰贬损为“旧时代鸦片”的人们，如今被我们努力取得的成果狠狠打了脸。正是靠着广大基督徒的选票我们才能赢得了第一次大选，而这些善男信女也将在未来的大选当中继续支持着我们！我们之所以让这一点成为可能，是因为我们注意到了一个其他政党所忽视的一点：伊比利亚联盟以及其成员国现在是将来也都会是基督教国家，我们共同肩负着近两千年的光辉遗产。舍弃我们作为社会基石的信仰无疑是愚蠢的，而去积极地寻求毁灭她则无疑是疯狂的。"
 IBR_AP_oil_crisis:0 "石油危机"
 IBR_AP_oil_crisis_desc:0 "该死！中东地区的不稳定局势已经酿成了一场经济危机。媒体已经将其称为“石油危机”。我们对于中东地区石油的依赖意味着我们在这场危机当中受到了特别严重的打击；与此同时，我们的经济学家预测经济衰退已经迫在眉睫。面对这一危机，我们的政府需要成为风暴当中的明灯，引导伊比利亚这艘大船渡过难关。"

 IBR_temporary_autarky_tt:0 "政府会开始实行财政紧缩，以帮助伊比利亚度过这场危机。"
 IBR_Emergency_Austerity_desc:0 "对我们的新政府来说，采取严格的紧缩政策的必要性显然是与日俱增了。我们政府的计划是开源节流：一方面我们要全面加税，另一方面又要裁撤掉前届政府留下的浪费性开支。通过约束我国政府的开支，我们应该能够让目前的危机并不会比目前的状况来说更糟。\n\n虽然这些政策会让民众对我们政府的好感大大降低，但我们也只能祈祷我们的政府能够挺过这场危机。这样我们才能够在危机结束后终止这类措施。"
 IBR_Freeze_Salaries_AP:0 "暂停加薪"
 IBR_freeze_salaries_tt:0 "我们会暂停加薪，以避免大规模的失业。"
 IBR_Freeze_Salaries_AP_desc:0 "随着财政紧缩措施开始实行，许多在先前受到补贴的行业如今正在勉力给其员工发放工资，这已经造成了一波失业大潮和员工降薪了。如果这一趋势无法得到扭转，随着消费支出和商业投资不断减少，我们的经济势必陷入瘫痪。这就是为什么冻结工资势在必行，我们要防止在经济危机的同时又撞上失业危机。\n\n然而，许多我们在大选期间所讨好的商业领袖都在私底下表达了他们对如今政策的不满，看来我们要在未来适时地予以安抚了。"

 IBR_Oil_Ration_AP_desc:0 "随着我们的石油库存接近枯竭同时获得新石油的希望渺茫，我们必须尽快建立起燃油配给制度，以在我们获取更多地原有或是找到替代能源前保留我们仅有的一点库存。如今，许多生活消费品都依赖石油，从汽车到塑料制品无所不包，石油短缺可能会导致抗议四起，甚至是引发动乱。\n\n配给制度势必不会受普罗大众和实业家们的欢迎，因此该制度不应太过严苛，以免发生群众抗议又或是资本外逃。"
 IBR_Social_Security_Cutbacks:0 "削减社会保障"
 IBR_cutback_ss_tt:0 "社保局经费将被削减，以减少我们的开支。"
 IBR_Social_Security_Cutbacks_desc:0 "虽然我们已经裁撤掉了一些十分浪费的开支，可我们的财政状况仍处于赤字状态。有鉴于此，我们决定针对社保局（即负责像是儿童保育等社会服务的主要机构）进行一轮精简并裁撤部分预算。如此我们的财政状况才能够恢复正常。\n\n为平衡账目所进行的预算削减会让许多广受老百姓欢迎的业务受到影响。可只要我们承诺在石油危机结束之后立刻恢复这些业务，兴许我们能够避免我党支持率因此急剧下跌。"
 IBR_Energetic_Diversification_AP:0 "能源多元化"
 IBR_Energetic_Diversification_AP_desc:0 "由于大众对我们的石油配给政策表达了明显的不满，因此，政府需要找到替代的能源。这不仅意味着伊比利亚人将用上电，同时也表示能有足够多的石油来满足日常消费的需求，这应该可以安抚大众的情绪。\n\n伊比利亚半岛有着充足的风力资源，因此政府正在对风力发电进行大规模的调查工作，咨询各行各业的专家，包括科学家、工程师和建筑师。同时还将新建五个核电站。"

 IBR_increase_taxes_tt:0 "为了让国库充盈，我们会增加税收。"
 IBR_Tax_Increase_AP_desc:0 "至少对我们自己的选民来说这会是最不受欢迎的一项措施，在我们采取了财政紧缩的经济措施之后，我们需要进一步增税。截至目前，我们所采取的减少财政赤字的措施都收效甚微。然而，我们又不得不提高所得税和商品税，否则我们在忙于经济危机之外又要去应付债务危机了。\n\n为确保这项措施的顺利落实，我们计划将公司税降低2%。如此我们就能够说服党内一些顽固派为相关的议案投赞成票。"

 IBR_a_proud_state_desc:0 "我们现在须回顾一份丰厚的遗产。伊比利亚是建立在巨人的肩膀上的，我们继承了葡萄牙帝国和西班牙帝国这两大强权的遗产：她们曾让广袤的土地受到文明开化，让基督的福音传遍千里。她们为后世塑造了一整片大陆的风土人情。这难道不是一段光辉岁月吗？尽管我们无法有幸去按照我们的愿景去塑造一片大陆，可我们的人民却开始淡忘他们祖先的丰功伟绩。伊比利亚是一个基督教国家，她有着自己的道德情操并会永远骄傲地成为基督的后盾。"
 IBR_principles_of_christian_civilization:0 "基督教文明准则"
 IBR_principles_of_christian_civilization_desc:0 "道德、信仰、服从。此三者便是联系所有基督教国家的纽带，如若没有这三者维系，我们都将堕入那无政府地狱当中。恐怖分子最想让我们做的就是摒弃这三条纽带从而让我们陷入无助任由他们宰割。有鉴于此，我们要做的就是不让这三大价值观就此消失，否则我们将步它们的后尘。"
 IBR_mastery_of_propaganda:0 "宣传专精"
 IBR_mastery_of_propaganda_desc:0 "我们的宣传的目的，与其名称相反，并非出于恶意。更确切地说，是出于国家的道德利益。时过境迁，民众早已忘却基督教价值观在他们生活当中所扮演的角色，而我们所要做的就是要让大众聆听耶稣的教诲，将他们从这永恒的诅咒当中拯救出来。\n\n所幸我们正好有办法来让基督的福音广布民众当中。在我们的政府当中就有这样子一批才华横溢的宣传专家，只要给他们一点培训的话，他们也一定会是很棒的传教士。总之，这些巧舌如簧的雄辩家们会在大众宣传上得到我们的全面支持。"

 IBR_instigate_national_fervor_desc:0 "我们都是天主教徒，但不仅如此，我们也都是伊比利亚人。有时民众会忘记这一不怎么方便的事实。健忘乃人之常情，因此重要的是要时刻给予民众以警醒。一个共同的敌人恰好会提醒民众团结一致，让他们共同抗敌。所以我们需要有一个目标，而这个目标将被宣传成一个威胁。之后的事情就很好办，将人们的仇恨引向这一“威胁”将民众的注意力顺利从政府身上转移。所以现在就剩一个问题：谁会是我们的仇恨目标呢？"
 IBR_oppose_international_leftism:0 "打击国际左派"
 IBR_oppose_international_leftism_desc:0 "显然，共产党、左翼分子和布尔什维克都是一丘之貉，幻想摧毁伊比利亚联盟。这些恶徒蠢到想把国家变得满地都是那些无能的无政府公社。由于他们激进的政见，把它们变成描述成一帮卑鄙之徒将易如反掌。我们会挑起对目前宣传的攻击，再把罪名按给他们——这是一石二鸟之策。无论何时，我们和人民都要做好棒打出头鸟的准备。"
 IBR_investigate_the_union_republicana:0 "调查共和联盟"
 IBR_investigate_the_union_republicana_desc:0 "共和联盟是一个想在伊比利亚有一席之地的极其可疑的团体，并且他们的主张已经给他们带来了不容小觑的实力。他们的行动不仅危险，而且也和他们的左翼纲领相悖。只有一个问题摆在我们面前——我们没有证据。为了名正言顺的开展行动，我们必须找到共和联盟和恐怖分子合作的罪证。一切成果都将成为对付他们的利器。"
 IBR_strike_at_democracy:0 "攻击民主"
 IBR_strike_at_democracy_desc:0 "伊比利亚各政党的合法地位不仅仅是站不住脚的，它们让人无法接受！这些政党大部分是布尔什维克阵线的，而剩下那些不是的则充斥着分不清企业和机构的蠢蛋。既为联盟大计，这一情况不能继续下去了！我们会找出一些新的“证据”，其中会指出这些党派要么与恐怖分子暗通款曲要么就是与分离主义阵线狼狈为奸，藉此我们可以抹黑甚至于直接打到任何反对国民联盟的家伙。"
 IBR_an_organic_state:0 "有机之国"
 IBR_an_organic_state_desc:0 "伊比利亚联盟就如同一个生命体一样。她就像一个有机体一般日新月异，不断进化着。她由许许多多小的部分组成，汇聚成了如今的伊比利亚。因此，我们把联盟称作是一个有机的国度不是恰如其分吗？另外，伊比利亚非常依赖她各个组成部分。这些部分就如同机器当中的齿轮，一旦有一个发生脱落，整台机器都将无法运转。因此我们不能够让任何一个部件发生偏移。在伊比利亚每个人都有着自己的位置，而每个人都必须各司其职。"
 IBR_social_catholicism:0 "社会天主教主义"
 IBR_social_catholicism_desc:0 "宗教是一个道德社会与功能社会的基础。可悲的是，伊比利亚人似乎对其重要性一直未能充分理解。但正如我们致力的那样，无神论的倾向一定会逐渐减少。每一个孩童都需要被教育接受天主教社会的传统价值观，也要让他们意识到公共利益的重要性。毕竟，这便是教义所在：集体永远高于个人，不认同之人永世不得超生。"
 IBR_discuss_corporatism:0 "为法团主义正名"
 IBR_discuss_corporatism_desc:0 "联盟是由有机体组成的一个有机整体，这是毫无疑问的。为了让其发挥更大的作用，我们必须有效利用其中每一个部分。而法团组织，则是在这一有机体中最有活力的一部分，法团组织便是我们身体的细胞，若失去了法团，我们将会失去一切。但遗憾的是，似乎到目前为止，“法团主义”一词被不必要的污名化了。让人们改变看法可能还需要一段时间，因此，我们将会积极推行法团政策，最终让群众彻底接纳法团主义。"

 IBR_look_to_the_past_desc:0 "古往今来，无数威名远播的帝国迎来送往，身为帝国之名的继承者，这名分便是他们予我等的馈赠。然而，我们空有其名。先辈能够缔造那般辉煌，想必他们有其过人之处。要让属于他们的荣光照耀我等，我们有必要借鉴他们的举措。他们做了什么能达到如此高度？显然，他们所行之事我们不曾做到。为了联盟的兴旺发达，我们不能再这样碌碌无为了。先辈的荣耀必将再次属于我们。"
 IBR_regional_decentralization:0 "地方分权"
 IBR_regional_decentralization_desc:0 "有很多政策是先辈不曾有过的。为了规避他们的不足，显然我们不会对他们照搬照抄——照搬照抄未免过于愚蠢了。但是必须承认，他们的许多想法都极具价值。封建的时代早已过去，但封建时代的政策不能消失。这里有必要重复一遍，伊比利亚联盟永远不会有贵族和男爵，但封建制度中的权力下放是要有的。毕竟，一具有机体固然复杂，但它的工作原理十分简单：头脑发号施令，肌体的各个部分如实执行。我们要做的就是赋予肌体以执行命令的权利。"
 IBR_take_aim_at_the_fundamental_laws:0 "以基本法为目标"
 IBR_take_aim_at_the_fundamental_laws_desc:0 "民主制度固然有助于赋予行为以合法性，但它也带来了一个让人烦恼的弊端。你必须要对你所做的事情负政治责任，而所获得的合法性往往不值得你去应对反对派的纠缠。我们将永远受到左翼分子和布尔什维克的反对，因为他们有能力操纵制度以维持他们的权力。更恶心的是，对个人超过集体的执着已经摧毁了联盟的道德标准，直到最终只剩下混乱与堕落。\n\n这破败的体制与我们的激进改革是不相容的。民主不过是左翼篡夺权力、反抗人民意愿的幌子。当务之急是明确的：为了伊比利亚的利益，必须废除现行制度。同样，任何反对意见都必须噤声。虽然彻底拆除这些骗局需要很长时间，但这是值得的。唯一的担忧之处，是受到思想束缚的人们或许会因执念而抵制这些改革。但岁月的流转终会让他们心怀开放，最终迎来接纳的时刻。"
 IBR_prioritize_the_farmers:0 "农民优先"
 IBR_prioritize_the_farmers_desc:0 "在联盟中，有谁能媲美朴实的农夫呢？他们是谦逊之人，过着朴素而卑微的生活。农业领域为伊比利亚构建了坚实支柱，我们的农产品赢得了世界的羡慕。不止如此，农民更是出色的天主教徒，他们忠贞而虔诚。在对信仰的坚守下，耕耘者成为真正有机统一的典范。他们不知疲倦的辛勤努力不只为了个人，更是为整体的繁荣。即便需要牺牲个人利益，这些乡村英雄也应该因他们的执着奉献而得到应有的回报。透过合作的益处，这些坚定的灵魂能够照亮联盟的价值，启发他人携手联合。"
 IBR_redistribute_the_power:0 "权力的转移"
 IBR_redistribute_the_power_desc:0 "终于，伊比利亚正在朝着更高尚的方向发展。联盟正在逐渐适应他们在社会中的地位，我们几乎不再需要制止异议之声。凭借人民的认可，我们可以开始平衡权力的天平。尽管人们竭尽全力，却也未必明了什么对他们最有益。所以决策的权力将移交给专家，他们了解如何为每个人提供确切所需。作为对他们听任的代偿，我们的一些忠实支持者可以在各种事务中获得公正的控制权。"
 IBR_estado_novo:0 "新国家体制"
 IBR_estado_novo_desc:0 "一切都已经结束了，再也没有虚伪的民主和所谓的“共和主义了”。我们的政府已经被完美整合了，所有的政见不合者都已经屈服于我们的意愿之下。所有的左翼以及他们的联盟都已灰飞烟灭，再也不能危及政府的稳定。慢慢的，少数族裔的存在将会被抹灭，成为人们的记忆，最终消失在历史的长河之中。所有的分离主义通敌者，都已被我们的铁拳所粉碎。距离继承考迪罗的遗产只有一步之遥了。\n\n我们将会宣告“新国家”的诞生，国会将会被人民的浪潮所卷走，伊比利亚将再真正的归于人民的统治之下。"
 IBR_national_union_oil_crisis:0 "石油危机"
 IBR_national_union_oil_crisis_desc:0 "糟糕！中东地区的动荡导致了经济危机，媒体已经将这场狂潮戏称为“石油危机”。我们对中东石油的依赖意味着我们受到了危机的严重冲击，经济学家预测将出现经济衰退。这意味着我们的政府必须抵御风暴，引领伊比利亚的巨轮穿越这场困局。"

 IBR_oil_priority_lists:0 "石油优先级列表"
 IBR_oil_priority_lists_desc:0 "国家的石油储备正在枯竭，因此必须将石油转移至社会上最需要它的领域。例如，为了确保伊比利亚在不断发展的经济危机中维持稳定，军队必须得到足够的石油补给。\n\n毫无疑问，削减国家大部分能源供应的举措将会引起公民和企业的不满，但在局势受控之前，这是一项必要之举。"
 IBR_less_pay:0 "减工减酬"
 IBR_less_pay_desc:0 "不幸的是，石油危机已经导致了国家失业率的大幅上升。伊比利亚的企业被迫不断地裁员，而我们必须采取切实的行动来应对这一困境。\n\n为避免失业问题进一步恶化，每个伊比利亚工人都需要团结一致，互相支持，在困苦的低薪期度过，直到我们渡过这场风暴。我们甚至会采取完全冻结薪资的措施，尽管这是一个令人揪心的政策。"
 IBR_cuts_public_services:0 "削减公共服务"
 IBR_cuts_public_services_desc:0 "同时，人民联盟和民主革新党提出了大规模的预算削减以应对当前的形势。政府得出的结论是需要对多方面削减开支，包括适度削减伊比利亚社会服务核心机构社保局的预算。\n\n对此，人们可能会因为不足的失业保险、养老金和医疗保健等服务而产生不满情绪。我们将向公众传达这些削减是暂时的，仅仅是为了度过这段最艰难的时期。"

 IBR_raise_consumption_tax:0 "提高消费税"
 IBR_raise_consumption_tax_desc:0 "为了进一步增加国库收入，我们必须提高税收，因为开支缺口不断扩大，而收入却在减少。具有争议的是，政府已经决定提高消费税以帮助国家走出经济低谷，尤其对是石油及其衍生产品的税收。\n\n有人认为这将伤害寻常百姓，但这却是应对肆虐在伊比利亚的风暴所必需的一步。"
 IBR_work_with_corporations:0 "与公司合作"
 IBR_work_with_corporations_desc:0 "在与伊比利亚商业领袖以及代表他们利益的雇主和行业协会进行了一系列会议后，我们起草了一份旨在改善他们状况的关键措施清单。其中喜闻乐见的是减税和放宽企业监管。\n\n抛开外部影响和国家财政损失，我们需要这些举措以让企业在风暴时期中保持稳定。\n"
 IBR_get_around_tariffs:0 "避开外国关税"
 IBR_get_around_tariffs_desc:0 "伊比利亚迫切需要能够向全球出售其产品，否则我们的主要出口产业可能会受到严重冲击。世界各国正在加大对外国产品的关税，以保护本国产业，但或许伊比利亚可以向其出口伙伴提出一个方案，试图消除贸易壁垒。\n\n在这最关键的时刻，提供专属贸易权和外交让步可能有助于在必要时扩大我们的贸易伙伴关系。"

 IBR_fight_inflation:0 "控制通胀"
 IBR_fight_inflation_desc:0 "持续恶化的通胀已经造成了市场风险扩大以及经济活动减少，我们将执行一系列政策以控制通胀。伊比利亚中央银行已经关键性地加息以鼓励储蓄。\n\n尽管抑制通胀是必要的，但严厉的措施也可能影响到社会上一些弱势群体。"

 IBR_loosen_state_control_desc:0 "两位考迪罗，尤其是考迪罗佛朗哥，对政府首席经济顾问的最新提议感到不满，但他们也明白，有些事不得不为。国家稳定计划将会见证伊比利亚的货币政策自由化以及部分产业私有化，以驱动国家摆脱自其诞生之初便禁锢其的法团主义经济体系。\n\n经济体系难以为继，只得推倒重做。"

 IBR_return_to_tradition:0 "回归传统"
 IBR_return_to_tradition_desc:0 "Tradition is tradition for a reason, it works, simple as that. It wouldn't be tradition if it didn't. Some might say that these traditions never worked well in the first place and that we're only deluding ourselves, but they can dwell on their wrongness on the boat ride over to Tarrafal. In the face of liberalism and decadence, we shall stand firm."

 IBR_more_power_to_the_military_desc:0 "The military has always been a loyal faction, having been a key instrument in our success in the Spanish Civil War. It only makes sense to reward their loyalty with some additional powers, to provide additional motivation. Granted, there are some who fear this may pave the way for a military coup, but our Caudillos are regarded by the army as father figures, so obviously they would have no reason to do this."

 IBR_tighten_our_grip:0 "拉紧缰绳"
 IBR_tighten_our_grip_desc:0 "National Syndicalism with Iberian characteristics isn't going to be enforced by sitting on our asses. It would do us no good to allow miscreants to keep causing trouble due to our leniency, so it stands to reason that we should consolidate power even tighter. Doubters and wreckers shall feel the iron grip of the state before long."
 IBR_cement_caudillos:0 "巩固考迪罗的权力"
 IBR_cement_caudillos_desc:0 "Caudillos have jointly ruled Iberia for many years, through times of prosperity and times of turmoil. The problems our nation faces do not arise from the centralization of power, as some claim, but in fact just the opposite: our Caudillos are constrained by petty bureaucracy. If we free them from these bonds and restrictions, they'll have more room to shape our nation into something great."
 IBR_encourage_youth:0 "激励年轻人"
 IBR_encourage_youth_desc:0 "虽然成年人可能懂得审时度势、配合我们，但在实际执行我们的意识形态信仰方面，他们是失败的。另一方面，孩子们的可塑性极强。通过将特殊的学校课程和课外活动相结合、灌输爱国主义思想，伊比利亚青年将成为我们事业的真正信徒，并准备在成年后为之牺牲。"
 IBR_catholic_education:0 "天主教教育"
 IBR_catholic_education_desc:0 "天主教是我们社会的道德支柱。巧合的是，天主教会也支持我们的统治。要忠于祖国和领袖，我们必须首先忠于予我等以馈赠的上帝。在年轻人看来，我们的统治不仅在政治上是明智的，而且在这个充满堕落的世界里，也是客观的道德选择。"
 IBR_state_media:0 "国有媒体"
 IBR_state_media_desc:0 "为了有效控制民众的思想，我们需要建立一个清晰的、能够覆盖一切的话语体系。但是一旦存在半独立、自认为与官方叙事对立是“众人皆醉我独醒”的新闻媒体，那这事就不好办了。要建立一个有凝聚力的社会，就必须加强国家对媒体的全面控制。毕竟，只要同样的话重复得足够多，没头没脑的民众就会相信。"
 IBR_iberian_grand_prix:0 "伊比利亚赛车大奖赛"
 IBR_iberian_grand_prix_desc:0 "With political issues in Iberia stealing the limelight, our Caudillos have decided to organise a Grand Prix event in order to direct the attention of the common man away from far more pressing issues. Of course it will only be a national affair, with no minority or separatist teams allowed to participate. Watching the Portuguese and Spanish teams compete in this high speed sport should invoke a combination of patriotism, unity, and national fervor in our population, perfect for keeping potential dissenters subdued for the moment."

 IBR_cracking_down_on_democracy_desc:0 "在这个世界上，没什么比“民主”这个虚假的神祸害更大了，它认为国家政策应该由一群无知暴民的突发奇想来控制。自由主义只会让我们伟大的国家被撕成碎片，为了“自由”而陷入混乱和无政府状态。这种倾向必须得到遏制，或许我们可以用某种方式将考迪罗的统治描绘成“真正的”自由。"
 IBR_caudillos_know_best:0 "考迪罗最懂"
 IBR_caudillos_know_best_desc:0 "Our Caudillos, guides of two nations united in harmony, are our leaders for a reason. They rose to their position based on merit and the grace of God, and serve as rallying points for Iberian patriotism.

 IBR_grand_parade:0 "盛大阅兵"
 IBR_grand_parade_desc:0 "A parade to show the prowess and might of the Iberian military is long overdue in our great nation. We shall hold a three day long parade in Valencia, in defiance of the Catalan separatists still lurking within our borders. The army, navy, and airforce will each have a day in the limelight, with the latest and greatest Iberian military vehicles and technology on display to the public. Not only is this a chance to show our populace the Iberian military means business, it is also a perfect time to show off to our competitors and watch them cower in fear of our mighty nation."
 IBR_crush_dissent:0 "镇压异议"
 IBR_crush_dissent_desc:0 "Our glorious union has no place for those that wish to undermine the greater good. The various minority groups, the independence movements, and regional governors all work to bog down the nation of Iberia with their demands and attempts at deviation, leading to the rise of terrorist groups that threaten to destroy our motherland. We've gone rather easy on them, but now the line must be drawn here. This far, no further!"
 IBR_matter_of_minorities:0 "少数民族事务"
 IBR_matter_of_minorities_desc:0 "At the center of all the dissatisfaction with our rule are the minorities among us. Not content with their place, they feel the need to incessantly screech about \"ethnic self-determination\" and \"representation in government\", as though living in our great nation isn't a reward enough. These complainers will have to be dealt with first, as they are probably the biggest source of terrorism in Iberia."

 IBR_guns_for_the_guardia_civil_desc:0 "国民警卫队，作为国家官方的警察力量，其在杜绝罪犯和叛乱分子破坏我们的社会工作上已被证明是至关重要的。他们理应得到增强，以便于更有效地清除敌人。很快我们的敌人们就无处遁形，无路可逃。"
 IBR_ending_regional_autonomy:0 "终结地区自治"
 IBR_ending_regional_autonomy_desc:0 "For far too long, we have over-delegated our authority, leaving some parts of it in the hands of local leaders. And as we all know, leaders that aren't the Caudillos are prone to doing the wrong thing, no matter how loyal they might be. It's time for trusted Iberians to assume direct control and have the ability to impose their whims without interference from pesky local governments."
 IBR_strengthen_the_axencia:0 "强化反分裂局"
 IBR_strengthen_the_axencia_desc:0 "显然，致力于调查和挫败伊比利亚分离主义阴谋的反分裂局工作不力。联盟各地的分离主义袭击都在加剧。在愈发认同他们的民众中铲除这些叛匪日益艰难，他们有望在民众当中得到越来越多的支持。这不可容忍。阻止这种令人不安的趋势的唯一方法是提高反分裂局的工作效率、以至事半功倍。所有腐败官员都将被撤职，其余的会接受忠诚度评估，以确保他们不会得到不该享有的同情。最后，他们需要更多的物资来工作。"
 IBR_the_issue_of_languages:0 "语言问题"
 IBR_the_issue_of_languages_desc:0 "Iberia is home to several distinct languages and regional dialects that have proven resilient and resistant to other past governments that have tried to stamp them out. While the only two approved languages, Portuguese and Castilian, are used in government, education and the military, that hasn't stopped Catalan, Basque, and Galician from being used commonly at home and at work in their respective regions. If we are to resolve this linguistic disunity in Iberia, we must work quickly and consider several options in order to unify and formalise our approved languages and dialects."
 IBR_regions_subdued:0 "压制地方"
 IBR_regions_subdued_desc:0 "The separatists within our great nation have finally been crushed. The dastardly Basques, the cowardly Galicians and the troublesome Catalans have been crushed beneath the superior Iberian jackboot, and now it is time to finally solidify our control and administration of these once rebellious regions. Local government apparatus will be dismantled, and any regional autonomy stripped away ruthlessly. We must be merciless if we are to create a stable and prosperous Iberia!"

 IBR_despotist_oil_crisis:0 "石油危机"
 IBR_despotist_oil_crisis_desc:0 "糟糕！中东地区的动荡已经演变成了一场经济危机，媒体称其为“石油危机”。我们对中东石油的依赖使我们在这场危机中损失惨重，经济学家们预测伊比利亚将会遭遇一次经济衰退。至此境况，政府有必要挺身而出，带领伊比利亚渡过难关。"

 IBR_a_candle_for_light:0 "用蜡烛照明"
 IBR_a_candle_for_light_desc:0 "人们为什么非得用灯具呢，既然蜡烛不需要油就能照亮房子，那还浪费完美的油干吗？为了减轻市民的担忧，我们应当推广蜡烛作为照明手段。当然，蜡烛或许并没有那么好用，但是现在是困难时期，为了国家的繁荣，每个人都应当做出牺牲。"
 IBR_a_horse_for_transport:0 "用马匹运输"
 IBR_a_horse_for_transport_desc:0 "我们的祖先已经使用这些四条腿的美人上千年了，而且它们不需要吃油。既然马能够胜任同样的任务，那民众就没必要把油浪费在汽车上了。为了缓解交通工具不足带来的问题，我们应该把多余的马分给人民，并开始大规模生产马车。的确，它们不如汽车跑得快，但是国家的需要的确比人民的需要更重要。"
 IBR_only_heat_for_the_pan:0 "够做饭就得了"
 IBR_only_heat_for_the_pan_desc:0 "让我们诚实一点，人们真的需要为他们的房子供暖吗？大多是时候，这只是为了让人变得舒适，而舒适则是我们面对这样的危机时最不该考虑的事情。为了重要的目的，比如烹饪会让人生病的食物时，必须保存热源，而且即便如此也要省着用。如果民众感到寒冷，他们可以盖着毯子挤在一起。据说，人体本就是个巨大的能量源，或许他们应该更多的利用自己的身体，而不是在我们的石油供应中占便宜。"
 IBR_all_for_the_military:0 "全面投入军事"
 IBR_all_for_the_military_desc:0 "即使在这种时期，确保军队得到所需要的一切这件事依然至关重要。军队不仅能提供最基本的政治便利，它更是伊比利亚的骄傲。他们坚定且忠诚，是我们对抗恐怖分子和分裂势力的最强防线。如果我们任由石油短缺破坏我们的骄傲，那么我们作为国家就真的失败了。\n\n尽管石油供应的确捉襟见肘，但是在我们实行紧缩政策的情况下，我们有能力确保军队拥有作战所需的燃料，并且还能有些储备。毕竟，我们的士兵可不能靠着蜡烛和马过活。"
 IBR_the_fight_for_iberia:0 "为伊比利亚而战"
 IBR_the_fight_for_iberia_desc:0 "We have more than just the material needs of Iberia to consider. Even now, during our most trying hour, sinister enemies plot towards our death. Communists, terrorists, separatists, and many others besides seek to destroy us, to rend our Union for the crime of daring to exist. They hide within our civilians, both using them as shields and converting them to their cult of treason.\n\nTo stop the cancer from growing, we must win the hearts and minds of Iberians. It is not enough to ensure the state's survival; we must also ensure that it is beloved by the people within it. If our policies aren't supported, then they will do nothing to save us."
 IBR_blessed_is_the_simple_man:0 "淳朴的人有福了"

Blessed is the simple man, he who disregards the material world to bring himself closer to his faith. Blessed is the simple man, he who trusts his betters to apportion things as are necessary.\n\nThese lessons are simple, and matters of faith that all good Christians should learn. They would learn, if only someone would teach them. By teaching Iberian citizens the virtues of a simple life, we will find it ever-so-easier to bring them around to supporting austerity, and the moral lesson is only an added benefit."
 IBR_just_enough_on_the_plate:0 "够吃就行"
 IBR_just_enough_on_the_plate_desc:0 "How much do you really need to eat? Certainly, nobody should starve - we live in a modern country, and to abandon our people in such a way would be admitting that we do not - but this usually fails to account for what is considered starvation. Many would claim that a ready access to large amounts of cooked food is starvation. It is not.\n\nThe truth is, this recent crisis must force Iberians to reconsider their dietary habits. Much food requires cooking, and cooking burns oil we cannot afford to waste. If citizens absolutely cannot do without cooked food, then very well, but they must take care to only cook the minimum."
 IBR_olives_to_bullets:0 "从橄榄到子弹"
 IBR_olives_to_bullets_desc:0 "If there is one thing an oil crisis like this brings on, it is instability. Terrorists and separatists plot in our midst, and their whispers grow more seductive to the people during these trying times, as we cannot cater to every last whim held by the public. If we cannot totally win the hearts and minds of the people, and we should not depend on that solution, we must have the means to continue our existence regardless.\n\nThe military must acquire the necessary funding to continue operating how it must. Even if we must dig out olive pits to place in our guns, we will ensure the military has all the supplies and money it requires, no matter where we have to look for the funds."

 IBR_crush_the_masons_desc:0 "The Opus Dei. It was a mistake to ever let those freemason bastards into the government. They sold us on sweet tales of prosperity, of their policies bringing an economic miracle to Iberia, if only we would trust them. Their policies may have, for a time, but that was only to fool us. The masons, a group to be added with the terrorists and the separatists, are to blame for this crisis. We were only hit as hard as we were because of them. They prepared for something like this, and made sure to twist the knife as hard as possible.\n\nThe masons are guilty of treason, nothing less. We need to expunge them from our government, and not stop until the last of their traitorous scum are wiped from the peninsula. The populace will surely be more understanding of our policies once they realize that they are not our fault."
 IBR_the_ascetics_of_jesus:0 "耶稣般的苦行"
 IBR_the_ascetics_of_jesus_desc:0 "To be a Christian is to embrace His word, and to also embrace the words of Jesus Christ. It is not enough to simply listen to his words, for one to be a true Christian they must also follow in Jesus's footsteps, embracing his lifestyle and teachings. As it so happens, one of his teachings lines up with our goals closely enough to embrace it.\n\nJesus lived a simple life, disconnected from most comforts and happily making do with the minimum. Many of our modern luxuries are greatly connected to oil. By encouraging an ascetic lifestyle in the vein of Jesus, we could make it easier to adopt austerity measures - for they will have already partially adopted them."

There is one particular passage that is relevant for our current dealins:\n\n\"After a long time, in the third year, the word of the LORD came to Elijah: \"Go and present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain upon the Earth.\"\"\n\nWhen times were their most dire, Elijah kept to his faith in God. For his faith, he was rewarded with rain, solving his drought and banishing the false prophets. This passage applies to us, too. The false prophets, the terrorists and the separatists, they claim that they can save their people, but they are built on lies and falsehood. We shall remain faithful, and even though we are in a drought of fuel, it shall return to us as surely as the rains if we remain steadfast. Iberia will prevail!"

Bringing leftist elements into the political arena would only further destabilise the situation; what we need right now is consensus. Only useful and reliable parties that demonstrate their dedication to Iberia's best interests will be permitted in the Congress and apparatus of state.

The structure of our nation has nothing to do with that, and it shall not change. In fact, efforts must be redoubled to maintain it! Strengthen the foundations and the whole house will be much sturdier.

For the Iberian husband, there is no greater happiness than to live a life of honest work, supporting and being supported in turn by his loving, loyal wife. There is no greater glory for a wife than to give life to a new generation of good, strong Iberian boys and girls - the shapers of the future and the bearers of our dreams.

No more than anyone else, that's for certain. It is far more honest and noble to instead focus on the realities of womanhood. Feminists have painted traditional female roles as backwards and worthless, but this is little more than baseless slander! Even the Caudillos would admit that the men who keep Iberia safe and strong would be nothing without the fairer sex to bear their spirits aloft, endure the trials of childbirth and keep their homes from falling into chaos and disrepair. The men have had their hour in the propaganda spotlight; now it is time for the beautiful and strong women of our nation to be properly educated in the same manner. Perhaps the misguided nations of the world will even learn from our example!"

The important thing is that a semblance of stability has returned to society and the economy isn't about to keel over dead anymore.

Democracy is not something that simply springs up overnight to enjoy success from the get-go. It needs to be guided, cultivated... directed.

Now that the Iberian Council has been granted greater powers and influence over the nation, it is their task to also protect the people of the nation.\n\nHowever, how could a bunch of politicians do what the Caudillos have been doing for almost twenty years without committing mistakes? It is obvious that they can't be left alone to rule, so that's why it has been decided that the Caudillos will now own the title of Presidents for Life of the Iberian Council, to make sure that their advice and wisdom is taken into account by the new main force in Iberia. Radical changes in leadership right in the middle of this turbulent time would be nothing short of chaotic, and as such it is all but common sense to stick with what we've got."

Nobody's suggesting a return to purely regional governments, but it might make sense for the departments dealing with Andalusia to be in Andalusia, the ones dealing with Navarra to be in Navarra, and so on.

It occurred to the Congress recently that the result of this is likely to be a massive number of new parties forming and joining together in ad-hoc coalitions to oppose us; not something we ever want to deal with. Therefore, said limits will be raised by a substantial amount. We risk seeing the rise of large parties capable of opposing us, but we'll have plenty of time to adjust to the new limits, surely."

What they need, therefore, is not the large degree of social and economic freedom of Americans, nor the jackbooted tyranny of Germany.

We just need to cut back on some of the more extreme measures taken on a regular basis, like arbitrary arrests and unwarranted raids on prominent minority citizens.

Some of the old guard have even begun whispering in Franco's ear, insisting that the minorities cannot be trusted and that we are delivering Iberia to the jackals. We must do whatever it takes to ensure that our new policies function correctly and are well-received by the minorities, whether that be by greasing palms, directing Axencia to step up their clandestine activities, or even going behind the Caudillos' backs to appease separatist movements directly.

Every regional minority in the peninsula is now represented in government, allowed a token degree of administrative self-management and is no longer subject to systemic repression.

However... they have a good deal more common sense than many of the old guard, and are committed to achieving their goals through gradual reform rather than iron-fisted oppression. One of these goals that they have in mind is a new kind of regional autonomy, wherein minorities would be guaranteed core rights such as the use of their languages and the freedom to celebrate their traditions. At the same time, they would not be granted any kind of administrative autonomy. In effect, the regional governments would be run BY the people, but FOR the state.

True to its name, it is a solely cultural body, not a means by which the minorities may gain independence again. The CRC will manage any and all matters related to the diverse regional minorities of Spain and will be composed of both appointed and elected individuals.

Giving particular support to this plan is Salazar, who has been spearheading the effort to increase Iberia's relevance in Africa."

All we need to do is so much as ask and they will be willing to help, and more often than not have someone able to do what is needed.\n\nIt is said that a good song can lighten even the darkest heart, and there are many dark hearts in wartime. The American soldiers stationed in South Africa would most likely appreciate someone to sing for them, and for a sweet melody to raise their spirits. The Women's Movement has many talented singers in it, and they can be sent to Africa to play for the American troops. The concerts will be funded by us fully, and they are sure to appreciate what we can do for them."

Since American relations seem to be improving, it may be possible that they would be willing to participate in a few mutually beneficial programs. All it will take to bring them around to it will be a small amount of persuasion, and then some competent scheduling.\n\nIt is no secret that the Iberian and American naval fleets have a world of difference between them, with different doctrines, tactics, and officers all creating a vast gap between the two. Opposites attract, and a contrast of naval styles could prove very helpful. To this end, arrangements will be made for a joint naval exercise, which will prove invaluable in providing intelligence to better improve our strategies."
 IBR_Lease_Sao_Tome:0 "借出圣多美"
 IBR_Lease_Sao_Tome_desc:0 "São Tomé. One of the only Portuguese colonies to resist German incursion, and a stable and pleasant island. The island is a darling of Portugal, not for its beauty, but for its importance. It was first colonized to serve as a waypoint in the long and treacherous journey to India. Even though it has been centuries since then, and decades since the last time the island was necessary, it is not without use. The island is in a location of immense tactical value, able to serve as a dock for ships and a point through which to filter supplies. It is for these reasons that the Americans want to use it.\n\nAs a gesture of goodwill, we can effectively rent out the island to them, and allow them to use it as they please - so long as it is given back to us in fair shape. It so happens, conveniently, that a fair sum of money can be made off the deal."

 IBR_Provide_the_Maps_desc:0 "The Germans took the Portuguese colonies from their original owners. Ripping out the pride and soul of half of the Union, it was nothing short of an act of cruelty. Worst of all were the retornados, who were forced to flee their homelands to escape the tyranny that would affect them. The heart wrenching stories of those who have truly lost everything have made a very strong case to the government.\n\nTherefore, it is about time they got their revenge. If the Portuguese shall not have it, then the Germans assuredly won't either. Even though they seemingly took everything, there is something very important they failed to take. We still have the map of assets around Angola and it is unlikely that Germany has modified anything. It would be a shame if that map were to be given to the Americans, so that they could disable the infrastructure when they find necessary."

What no-one will tell you is that these environments are less different than one would think, and there is a lot of crossover between them. For example, there are many skills you can learn in one place that you could make use of in another. It is only logical that the Americans would appreciate learning some skills for their time in South Africa.\n\nWe will open up Guinea Bissau to the United States military, and in particular invite their special forces to come train in the area. They could use the practice to fight better in the hostile environments of Africa, where Guinea could prove a valuable introduction to it."

 IBR_Cancioneiro_Niassa_desc:0 "The mission of the Portuguese in Angola, their divinely ordained duty, was to civilize the people there. Since the Portuguese were chased away by the Nazis, that job was left only half-finished. Yet still, the history of Portuguese colonialism in the region is something that can be used to our advantage. One of the first things the settlers did was teach the inhabitants Portuguese, in order to better communicate with the natives. Portuguese language is by no means universal, but a significant enough number of Africans in the former colonies know the language to make alternative operations practical.\n\nWe will deploy forces able to use the power of song and voice to strike fear into the Africans fighting under German command, turning their traditions and customs against them. These operations will harm their morale, allowing the Americans a better chance."

Medics are not always on time, nor can they get to some places easily on land. What makes it worse is that they can't always get where they need to be by air, either - as they would have nowhere to land. The Portuguese airborne nurses have been created to solve that problem.\n\nThey will parachute out of helicopters and other aircraft at high altitudes, into hostile conditions, in order to save lives. Through thick and thin, no matter the risk. It is here that the bravest will shine, and those who are in it for a thrill will get exactly what they want. They will be like angels from heaven, come to bring salvation to those in need."

Because of their unique heritage, they are like ghosts. The Africans move from the land, strike, then hide with the native population before the Americans can so much as lift a finger. No longer!\n\nThe time has come to even the advantage. Some retornados were natural outdoorsmen, and have never truly forgotten their old home. For these qualities some have been approached by the CIA, who wish to recruit them for the war effort. If we allow them to, it could nullify the advantage the Africans have."

Clearly the mistake was prioritizing quality over quantity so highly, as we have sent barely anyone. Any advantage is quickly nullified by the total lack of people to capitalize on it. As it were, we will be sacrificing a bit of that fighting quality for numbers.\n\nTo this end we will reform the Viriatos volunteer divisions, originally deployed to Spain to assist Franco, many years ago. Many brave Portuguese men will be able to taste the honor of battle, made all the sweeter by revenge. They will not rest until Angola and Mozambique have been avenged!"

 IBR.1.d:0 "随着新年的到来，我们终于迎来了公布新基础设施扩建计划的大好时机。一开始，我们只会做一些微小的改进，为更大、更全面的联盟新经济结构计划建立基础框架。今年工程的亮点是在马德里郊区建设一条新的半主干道，考迪罗佛朗哥对该建设项目有着出人意料的兴趣。据报道，他经常视察不同的地点，对这项工程保持密切的关注。\n\n乐观的联盟官员似乎没有注意到，这项工程已经引发了葡萄牙社会各界的不满。葡萄牙许多地区的道路亟需修复，因此，往好了说，为数百英里外的道路提供建设资金似乎是徒劳无益的，但往坏了说，他们感到自己被联盟刻意忽视了。然而，参与这项工程的员工无一例外地相信，由于部署了大量安全部队专门监视分离主义恐怖分子，该项目的完成不会有任何障碍。更重要的是，他们意识到这项工程的启动可能会对整个联盟的基础设施建设产生潜在的影响。"
 IBR.1.a:0 "希望如此……"
 IBR.2.t:0 "马德里郊区公路提案"
 IBR.2.d:0 "不出所料，在两国都知晓了关于该项工程的讯息后，新的基础设施建设计划很快遭遇了与大多数政策提案一样的困境。我们已经收到不少反对的信件，字里行间透露这愤怒与不满。马德里内政部也接到了一大堆各界人士的抗议来电。他们对在西班牙首都外建设新高速公路的项目感到出奇的愤怒。我们的建筑设备也是个大问题，工人的国籍与设备的产地往往并不相同。如果不解决这个问题，伊比利亚的基建计划可能会彻底停摆；因此，我们必须考虑未来的选择。"
 IBR.2.a:0 "多用点葡萄牙制造的建筑设备。"
 IBR.2.b:0 "安抚一下，在里斯本也修条差不多的路。"
 IBR.3.t:0 "沥青混合料的问题"
 IBR.3.d:0 "由于一名态度尖锐的葡萄牙公务员注意到葡萄牙和西班牙对沥青混合物的用料规定存在分歧，从而引发了一场不小的争议，直接导致新基础设施工程的规划阶段被迫再度停止。如果在不进行介入的情况下继续施工，就有可能会把这条公路毁掉。考虑到这将涉及联盟双方之间的协调努力，确实有必要关注一下这个问题，至少还可以当个正面宣传材料。不过，这只是一条公路，更庞大的工程还尚未浮出水面。这些工程可以帮助稳定和团结伊比利亚。所以我们应该如何处理这个问题？"
 IBR.3.a:0 "这是西班牙的土地，必须实行西班牙的法律。"
 IBR.3.b:0 "呼吁尽快通过关于道路施工材料的联盟法律。"
 IBR.3.c:0 "谁还需要规定？用我们的材料。"
 IBR.4.t:0 "道路维修问题"
 IBR.4.d:0 "随着沥青混合料问题的解决和调查工作的进行，我们得以继续开展这项工程。国家批准的承包商成群结队地来到这里，他们已经取得了不小的进展。废旧的基础设施得到了拆除，这项新的大工程已经开工，国内外的记者应邀前去参观建筑工地，他们都对此惊叹不已；这一工程需要我们付出大量的时间和努力，因为一切都必须事先做好相应的准备。\n\n然而，就在一次普通的参观活动中，情况突然急转直下。时间在那一刻仿佛凝固了，一声毛骨悚然的尖叫将我们刚刚好不容易树立起来的完美形象撕得粉碎。\n\n沥青的爆炸撕裂了颤抖的大地，一道裂缝出现在了混凝土的道路上。在一处立交桥的地基上，有人刻意引爆了数吨炸药，留下了大片道路的坑洞，几天的辛劳已经化作了瓦砾和灰烬。大量物资和机器在爆炸引发的混乱中丢失或损毁。消防队在几分钟内就部署到位，随即立刻开始帮扶伤员，并试图从烧焦的废墟堆中搜救幸存者。我们已经确认有四人死亡，三百多名工人受伤，为我们需要立即完成的庞大维修工程增添了一笔昂贵的医疗费用。\n\n随后我们确认了在混乱中有人在用巴斯克语高喊：“坚持我们的道路！”(巴斯克独立口号)，看来属于社会主义恐怖组织的巴斯克分离派对此次袭击负有直接责任。因为有报道称，类似的恐怖活动也在困扰着其他地方政府资助的公共工程。SECED已经开始着手调查，但与此同时，我们还需要想个办法，该如何修改或调整我们的预算来应对这一缺口呢？我们该如何从这场灾难中恢复过来？"
 IBR.4.a:0 "申请从西班牙的税收里拨款。"
 IBR.4.b:0 "申请从伊比利亚的税收里拨款。"
 IBR.4.c:0 "走捷径——我们可以节省材料。"
 IBR.5.t:0 "调查"
 IBR.5.d:0 "我们为急需的修理找到了必要的资金，这在官僚主义如此盛行的地方真是一场噩梦。看起来我们终于可以继续了。签了合同的工人们被找回来了，资源被再次征用了，重型机械也已经预约好了。\n\n如果一切都如想象的这么简单的话。\n\n在正式开工维修的第一天清晨，工地上突然挤满了穿着深色西装的神秘人，他们迅速封锁了该地区，命令工人们立即撤离工地，还驱赶了几辆货车内的工头。当地区总督办公室接到其中一位承包商的解释电话时，他显得非常愤怒。然而，几名SECED特工的突然拜访打消了他指责什么人的念头，因为他们带来了一些……不太理想的新闻。\n\nSECED事先确认了爆炸事件的责任人：一群激进的巴斯克学生与左翼分子组成的分离主义小团体。他们的头目是伊尼戈·努涅兹，阿尔弗雷德努涅兹的表兄。SECED项目雇用承包商的一个工头称，有证据指控艾弗雷多可能协助他表兄的部下组织了这次爆炸，而且他不是唯一个打入了工程内部的人。因此，这群特工获得了正式授权，对我们雇佣的所有承包商进行调查和审计，以便找出其他任何像阿尔弗雷德那样可能具有分离主义思想的家伙。与此同时，在调查期间，道路工作必须马上停止，一切命令从即刻起立即生效。"
 IBR.5.a:0 "你他娘的在跟我开玩笑吗？"
 IBR.6.t:0 "车道扩建？"
 IBR.6.d:0 "这项目应该很简单。它应该只是从A点到B点的双车道公路，但在伊比利亚的动荡时期，没有什么可以那么简单。让这条道路得到多个部门批准的时间远远长于实际建设量所需的时间。每件小事都必须签署五十个条款，并经过一百个环节才能做成，就算臃肿的官僚机构没有让我们以蜗牛的速度前行，人行道的混合料也足以引发种族冲突。\n\n当然，现在马德里政府已经参与了这条道路的建设，并且随之而来的是立法机构和行政管理的另一个层面。实际情况是：对道路的轰炸迫使我们建造了一个超宽的路肩，就算路被炸坏了，我们依旧可以从路肩运输器械。马德里政府现在要求我们将这个路肩变成一条全新的道路。他们要么不知道他们实际要求什么，要么更可能的是：他们根本不关心这些。\n\n这就是联盟政府的样子！你无法单靠自己做到这一切，你必须向联邦政府申请。然后你必须提交一堆上诉文书来申请许可才能真正改建我们正在施工的道路，之后就是漫长的等待期，而一个充斥着官员间裙带关系的委员会只是草草浏览你的文书就批准或否决你的想法。马德里政府要求最糟糕的部分是：它是对实际情况一无所知。我们不能将一个比平均稍大的路肩变成一个全新的车道！路肩必须扩大，预算必须重新计算，尽管过去几个月我们一直在处理官僚主义，但这样下去我们只会再次陷入无尽深渊之中。"
 IBR.6.a:0 "同意请求，向联邦政府上书。"
 IBR.6.b:0 "拒绝请求，让市政府见鬼去吧。"
 IBR.7.t:0 "建设规划完成"
 IBR.7.d:0 "在与官僚斗智斗勇并弥补缺陷之后，看来马德里外围的公路终于可以开工了。大承包商与公务员已经造出了细致的模型，如果一切顺利，只需几个月就可以完工，之后我们便可把目光投向更重要的基础设施检修项目。"
 IBR.7.a:0 "希望真的只用几个月就可以完工。"
 IBR.8.t:0 "葡萄牙否决工程条例"
 IBR.8.d:0 "葡萄牙政府的车队在马德里的老街上蜿蜒前行，它带来的消息势必将会造成恐慌。在马德里外围公路的建设过程中，葡萄牙非常愚蠢地否决了我们在选用沥青混合料时遵守西班牙法律而非葡萄牙法律的建议。\n\n据说这与砂石混合料造成的技术困难有关。但稍有政治头脑的人都清楚这是一种尝试，是对集权联盟中葡萄牙弱势地位的反抗，即便是在如此小的一件事情上。这种举措使得我们的工作效率更低而成本更高，而他们始终不愿乖乖低头承认联盟的其他部分有着更好的法律。工程简直无法继续。我们别无选择，只能试图找到解决这个问题的方法。总有些害群之马拦着我们，不过如果我们能找到他们并“说服”他们睁一只眼闭一只眼，那么我们最终还是可以节省大量的时间，金钱和精力——前提是我们必须确保其他任何人都不会发现这些不太光彩的手段。"
 IBR.8.a:0 "这样吧，把负责部门贿赂一通。"
 IBR.9.t:0 "许可变更被批准了"
 IBR.9.d:0 "联盟政府批准了我们对于建筑许可的变更，我们终于又可以开工了。这条新路现在将拥有马德里当局想要的车道数量。"
 IBR.9.a:0 "奇迹啊！"
 IBR.10.t:0 "西班牙拒绝变更许可"
 IBR.10.d:0 "西班牙政府拒绝了我们变更建筑许可的请求，他们表示，市政府既没有能力也没有权利对一个显然处于联邦管辖下的项目进行这种重大变更。我们没法增加车道数了。"
 IBR.10.a:0 "至少我们省下了钱。"
 IBR.11.t:0 "葡萄牙拒绝变更许可"
 IBR.11.d:0 "不幸的是，葡萄牙政府决定拒绝我们更改马德里外围公路建筑许可，建设更多车道的要求。他们声称，市政府既没有能力也没有权利对一个显然处于联邦管辖下的项目进行这种重大变更。这不仅意味着我们没有得到我们想要的，而且也预示了今后的谈判项目绝对会冷场。尽管我们离这个设施更近，受影响最大的也是我们，但我们现在只能期望他们对未来的这类项目能更明智一些，因为我们一旦尝试进一步参与，就会遭到政府高层的反对。"
 IBR.11.a:0 "至少我们省下了钱。"
 IBR.12.t:0 "利益冲突之争"
 IBR.12.d:0 "1962年基础设施检修计划又遇到了巨大的困难，这困难与参与其中的承包商和官僚有关，并已经引起了广泛的争论。政府中的高级内务官员越来越对修路的进程感兴趣，尤其是那些担心政府形象和宣传的官员。对滥用资金、挪用资金的指控，对劳工工时的指责以及欠薪的消息如一柄柄重锤，敲打在监工本就颤抖的肩膀上，让他们压力重重。工程目标与风评之间存在天然的冲突，就像鱼与熊掌。这一丑闻是否会无限制暂停工程，还要看伊比利亚政府对其的调查，不知这一丑闻之下是否藏有阴谋。"
 IBR.12.a:0 "伊比利亚什么时候开始关注腐败问题了？"
 IBR.13.t:0 "材料使用违反规定"
 IBR.13.d:0 "突击检查发现，我们并没有遵守沥青混合料的使用规定。伊比利亚政府因此对我们进行了罚款，他们要求我们在未来的建设中严控质量，让所有人满意。为什么政府雇佣的工人会被政府罚款，而且还是因为这个远远超出其工资对应的能力的原因，没有人知道。"
 IBR.13.a:0 "腐败问题在意料之中。"
 IBR.14.t:0 "联邦税收提案"
 IBR.14.d:0 "我们要求更多的联邦税收用于修路的请求最终被马德里和里斯本方面的官员接受了。我们的建设现在有望继续下去并最终完成，不会再有任何拖延。"
 IBR.14.a:0 "谢天谢地。"
 IBR.15.t:0 "西班牙税收提案"
 IBR.15.d:0 "我们向西班牙地区政府提出的关于用税款来修理这条道路的请求已被接受。这意味着我们终于可以回去工作，完成这个该死的项目了。"
 IBR.15.a:0 "好极了。"
 IBR.16.t:0 "伊比利亚拒绝提供资金"
 IBR.16.d:0 "伊比利亚联邦委员会拒绝为公路建设提供更多资金，称该项目已获得足够的资金以确保其完工。尽管他们对灾难性的爆炸袭击有广泛的了解。我们必须寻找其他资金来源。"
 IBR.16.a:0 "果不其然。"
 IBR.17.t:0 "西班牙拒绝提供资金"
 IBR.17.d:0 "西班牙地方政府拒绝为该项目提供更多资金，他们声称这个项目处于联盟层面，如果越俎代庖，很可能引起地区政府之间的进一步争吵。我们必须找到其他的资金来源。"
 IBR.17.a:0 "说得好像他们以后不会多管闲事了似的！"
 IBR.18.t:0 "道路建设完工"
 IBR.18.d:0 "最后，经过多次事故和延误，拟议中的马德里外公路现在终于可以使用了。这将是完善伊比利亚后勤基础设施系统的第一步，公路的完工使得伊比利亚有能力在国际市场上大展拳脚。然而还有一个问题……由谁进行剪彩？它将以谁的名字命名？这可不是一个容易解决的问题。"
 IBR.18.a:0 "不要再这样了！"
 IBR.190.t:0 "葡萄牙的机器坏掉了"
 IBR.190.d:0 "今天早晨，到达建筑工地的工人发现，所有装过混凝土混合料的机器都坏了，而工人都没有经过训练，无法修复。更为老道、熟练的工人也只是摇摇头，不愿相信这一切。似乎我们授权使用的这一批葡萄牙机械与铺路所需的混合物不适配，造成了无数的机械故障。如果我们想要完成这个项目，就得把这批机器换掉。"
 IBR.190.a:0 "这是谁干的？"
 IBR.19.t:0 "市政府叫停工程机械运输！"
 IBR.19.d:0 "在马德里市政府的请求被拒绝后，他们撤销了施工队在城中转运工程机械的许可。幸好，联盟政府及时介入，推翻了他们的撤销决定，但这还是意味着我们的工期不得不再次延误。"
 IBR.19.a:0 "又要延误？"
 IBR.20.t:0 "政府批准使用西班牙法律"
 IBR.20.d:0 "伊比利亚政府已经批准使用西班牙法律规定的沥青混合料和道路测量标准来建造马德里郊区公路。"
 IBR.20.a:0 "令人吃惊，但是可以接受。"
 IBR.21.t:0 "调查发现可疑活动"
 IBR.21.d:0 "对马德里郊区公路建设项目的调查发现了一些可疑的活动，其中包括欺诈、贿赂还有对雇工审查工作的忽视。为了减少此事对政府的损害，我们将会对建筑公司进行重罚。然而，没人关心这样是否会使工期进一步被延误。"
 IBR.21.a:0 "这将会更糟糕。"
 IBR.22.t:0 "调查发现可疑活动"
 IBR.22.d:0 "对马德里郊区公路建设项目的调查发现了许多可疑的活动，包括贿赂官员，另有一名工头与巴斯克分离主义组织有密切联系。国民警卫队已经突袭了工地，并逮捕了嫌疑人。"
 IBR.22.a:0 "绝对不能接受的行为。"
 IBR.23.t:0 "调查发现非常可疑的活动"
 IBR.23.d:0 "对马德里郊区公路建设项目的调查发现了许多可疑的活动，有一事尤其严重：我们发现参与的公司中有一个是从属于南意大利犯罪集团的皮包公司。我们的调查本想找出腐败的端倪，没想到却让伊比利亚政府摊上了一个小小的国际事件。"
 IBR.23.a:0 "他们是怎么蒙混过关的？"

 IBR.67.d:0 "今天，伊比利亚委员会第一次正式会议在国会宫召开。会议由佛朗哥和萨拉查主持，会上讨论了若干重要议题。\n\n第一项议程是关于德国局势，并且引发了一场十分漫长而激烈的讨论。许多成员认为，对德国的无端恐惧是毫无根据的，因为事实已经不止一次地表明他们完全缺乏对未来的筹划，对伊比利亚的任何威胁在出现后就会很快消失。不过也有小部分人认为，尽管德国人的筹划能力难称上乘，但他们仍有能力迅速采取行动，这可能会危及伊比利亚。\n\n另一个需要讨论的问题是如何修复伊比利亚经济，如果说关于德国问题的讨论称得上“激烈”的话，那么这个问题可以说把整个房间都炸开花了。委员会成员在这个问题上存有严重分歧，完全听不进与自己相左的提议，所以辩论很快仅就变成了部分成员之间的全武行，而两位考迪罗不得不被护送出房间。\n\n尽管这场全武行在会议室外无人知情，但媒体已经开始报道会议室内可能发生的事情，这让佛朗哥和萨拉查都很不爽。因此两人决定，会议室里会长期安排数名国民警卫队成员来监视成员；为了避免日后的冲突，委员会成员不允许以三人以上的团体进入国会宫的大厅。"
 IBR.67.a:0 "我们会牢牢控制他们的。"
 IBR.68.t:0 "操纵委员会成员比例"
 IBR.68.d:0 "虽然形式上，伊比利亚委员会的席位是按照这种方式分配的：以向两位考迪罗提供多样化的建议为目的，同时代表联盟各地权威人士持有的广泛观点。但现实情况显然不同。人人都知道伊比利亚政府分成了好几个派系，每个派系都在试图争夺更多的控制权和影响力，其中一些派系甚至有意公开反对两位考迪罗。为了防止委员会被这种有害的派系斗争吞噬，萨拉查想出了一个主意，让无脑支持他和佛朗哥的议员填满委员会。出人意料的是，佛朗哥同意了。\n\n然而，这种多到不成比例的代表权的安排是有代价的。许多政府成员抗议说，伊比利亚委员会没有完全按比例分配，某些“部门”比其他部门有更多的代表权。当然，当被问及这些“部门”时，大多数抱怨者都沉默了，因为束缚政府的派系斗争是禁忌话题，两位考迪罗一直不希望把这种事放到台面上来。\n\n在有人敢于开口之前，两位考迪罗可以坐下来放松一些，因为他们知道委员会成员会支持他们和他们的决定。"
 IBR.68.a:0 "委员会从一开始就被操纵了。"
 IBR.69.t:0 "国家新法"
 IBR.69.d:0 "在伊比利亚联盟成立之初，我们起草了一部宪法（算是吧）。在其中众多的条文中，最为知名的便是确立了两位考迪罗，弗朗西斯科·佛朗哥和安东尼奥·德·奥利韦拉·萨拉查共同拥有最高国家权力，无人可以僭越。\n\n当伊比利亚委员会成立之时，却并没有什么人在乎它是否合乎这一条乃至整部宪法。但最近新闻界的一篇文章指出了这一点，认为伊比利亚委员会的成立涉嫌违反伊比利亚宪法，并暗示两位考迪罗有意避免修宪来削弱自己的权力。\n\n而两位考迪罗则回应称他们将填补这一漏洞并修订宪法。在马德里召开的一次盛大的公众集会上，佛朗哥和萨拉查身着盛装，正式将伊比利亚委员会写入宪法。而媒体则嗤之以鼻，称佛朗哥和萨拉查不过是用了涂改液拿圆珠笔重写了一下而已。这成了人们心中对伊比利亚此次短暂的宪法危机最为印象深刻的描述。"
 IBR.69.a:0 "富有成效的变革。"
 IBR.70.t:0 "对委员会进行审计"
 IBR.70.d:0 "在这之前，腐败妨碍了伊比利亚政府的运转。虽然现在的腐败程度比十年前明显减轻，但随着考迪罗手中的部分权力被交予委员会，我们仍然有必要确保这些腐败问题不会蔓延到政府的最高层。\n\n有鉴于此，我们将立刻对所有未来的委员会成员进行审计，以便更好地了解他们的志向、财务状况和个人关系。虽然所有委员都已经过仔细审查，但再多一层审查肯定没有坏处。"
 IBR.70.a:0 "必要之举。"
 IBR.71.t:0 "控制委员会"
 IBR.71.d:0 "委员会中仍有一些人没有摆正自己的位置。他们认为自己的工作不是为了辅助两位考迪罗的工作，而是为了追求自己事业的发展。为此，我们有必要确保委员会运作不过于独立。从今天开始，在委员会的所有会议上将向委员会提供一份文件，供他们陈述会议准备达成的目标。议员们不会再争论应该追求什么样的目标，他们只会讨论如何最好地追求这些目标。\n\n随着新措施的初步实施，准议员们明显有些紧张。但是，他们都将在适当的时候适应自己的角色。"

 IBR.72.t:0 "加固选择权的幻象"
 IBR.72.d:0 "公众似乎有些担忧，认为委员会里全是忠于某位考迪罗的傀儡。这当然是真的。他们说，这些议员争执不断，甚至无法通过哪怕是最小的法律，这表明一切都没有改变，伊比利亚面临的问题远未得到解决。\n\n报纸已经在报道在委员会先期会议期间发生的各种事件。其中一起涉及两名议员在其中一名侮辱另一名议员的母亲后发生肢体冲突。\n\n为了解决这个问题，两位考迪罗决定允许“选举”委员会成员。实际上，所有候选人仍将由两位考迪罗亲自挑选。民众会认为他们在委员会事务中有发言权，他们的忧虑至少现在会被压制下去。"
 IBR.72.a:0 "最好让人们保持安静。"
 IBR.73.t:0 "控制代表"
 IBR.73.d:0 "某些地区代表表现得过于独立了。他们主张赋予各自省份更多权力。由于这个问题在联盟的西班牙部分更为严重，这个问题让考迪罗佛朗哥十分头疼。与此同时，萨拉查觉得这种情况很有趣。据说他吹嘘所有来自葡萄牙的代表都很忠诚，说一个好的领导人不会因为那些讨厌的政客而头疼。\n\n为此，佛朗哥提出了几个选择。我们可以把那些特别叛逆的代表撤职并以叛国罪投入监狱，不过此举可能会引发更多问题，但佛朗哥将掌握绝对控制权。当然，也有更温和的方法。佛朗哥可以决定简单地召回有问题的代表，如果他们惹了太多麻烦，那么更忠诚的人将取而代之。"

 IBR.405.a:0 "能出什么问题啊？"
 IBR.406.t:0 "钱可通神！"
 IBR.406.d:0 "这一次，两位考迪罗终于达成了共识。施佩尔胜率渺茫，就算他靠着我们的援助赢了内战，让他第一时间投桃报李，来拯救我们的经济也不现实。如果我们有意干涉内战，就至少得从中捞点好处。\n\n在讨论向谁卖武器时，萨拉查提出了一个好点子：只要有人想买，就卖给那个势力，卖得越多越好。通过简单的数学计算可知，此举可以为我们赢来四倍的利润，让我们能获得充足的资金让国家经济重归正轨，甚至可能彻底解决我们的问题。\n\n政府中的一些人依然对这一行为抱有顾虑，他们认为这种”加剧各方对抗烈度“的行为不道德。此外，他们还担心如果有一方发现我们在向其他势力卖武器，我们得到的可能就不只是外交谴责那么简单了，制裁也会随之而来，这是伊比利亚所不能承受的。还好，我们的考迪罗都是精英，他们肯定已经有了一个完美的计划。"

Göring, the proud, fat oaf, who had had the immense backing of most Wehrmacht personnel, was now the new Führer of the destroyed Reich, now but an army with a half functioning state. He had vanquished his opponents in hellfire, carving a deep scar into Germany, one that was unlikely to heal soon if ever. The unwavering militarist was likely already crafting extensive plans for foreign policy escapades with his hawkish advisors, while all around him ordinary people were suffering abject poverty and devastation.\n\nAn emergency council meeting had been called when the official declaration of victory had come from Germania, both Caudillos fearful of the danger that may soon face Europe and Iberia. Salazar seemingly had first been surprisingly joyous that it was not Heydrich who had climbed the iron throne of the Reich, but he also shared his Spanish counterparts apprehension of what an openly militaristic Germany could symbolise for their future. Their only hope was that the Reich still needed time to repair and prepare its offensive forces. If we act quickly we might be able to hold off the Germanic horde when it comes."

More effective and efficient defensive installations have been invented to compliment that are able to compliment the natural fortification that the Pyrenees Mountains gives our great Peninsula. Even more importantly military analysts have also concluded that the German hordes had enjoyed a great deal of luck in the conquests of France and the lowlands, something we will not allow them to have if they dare knock on our doors. However, some of our high command, especially those who advocate for increased special force use, have warned of naval invasions to try to take key strategic ports or possibly even take control over the Strait of Gibraltar.

It was what had driven the pragmatically opposed Caudillos in each other's arms in the first place, the starting shot of Iberian unification which Salazar had initially opposed based on sovereignty issues. With the loss of his treasured African colonies however, he had no other choice but to accept Franco's proposals for a united front against the reviled Germans.\n\nNow, the German Civil War was over, and the hated Göring stood victorious over his defeated foes. The expansionist, the military man. In time he would certainly bring the African Reichskommissars back under his jackboot and look to Equatorial Africa as another target. It was a simple assumption to make; therefore one Göring was likely to take into consideration.\n\nDespite the region originally having been a Spanish colony, Salazar was ecstatically pursuing plans to fortify the last Iberian stronghold below the Sahara. For once, for the usually collected Caudillo, this had become a matter of pride and prestige; Franco also not eager to lose what formally was just his colony, did not sit idly by either. Extensive plans for strong fortification lines and subsequent guerrilla warfare, once the lines would be breached, were drafted, military high command eager to follow the lead of their Caudillos as they saw the strong strategic use of drawing away more German forces from the European theater.

On this matter the two old men had finally come to full agreement, both were too fearful of the danger that was strengthening just beyond the horizon, a bond reforged that first had been set in place by the same man they now again may have to confront. Salazar even agreed with Franco to push total Iberian unity for the sake of a better prepared union. He also eventually caved to Franco's s suggestion to deal harshly but quietly with any resisting elements to the state, again a move towards better stability and unity.

Speer, the liberal and idol of Germany's youth, has won the German Civil War, a huge sigh of relief could almost be heard coming from all freedom loving peoples of this wretched earth. The Nazi reformer now becoming Führer was seen as a much appreciated shift away from the current dark paradigm that Europe has had to suffer for the last 20 years, conquest and economic ruin being its defining hallmarks. In Iberia this view was shared by the vast majority of the populace, even both Caudillos could for once agree that this was the best possible outcome of that terrible conflict, an outcome with a future that may not have to involve further war and death. The possibility of regained prosperity from trade, bettering of diplomatic relations, finally the chance for Europe to come closer together. After brief celebrations and a short meeting with other senior government officials, the two Caudillos parted ways for now, Salazar leaving with a secretive, yet buoyant grin. If everything went accordingly now and Speer kept to his reformist promises, the Iberian Union may become defunct as a necessary measure of unity against an external threat. Portugal could become independent again, sovereign again, reigned just by the pragmatist, regaining its lost glory. His daydream was almost too perfect, to be free of Franco and his split, mismanaged country. Whether Speer would be able to actually change Europe's oppressive, dark dynamic was yet to be seen, but for once Salazar could finally entertain the idea of hope."

 IBR.104.d:0 "While the public was still mostly celebrating and looking forward to a brighter future, the machinations of the never resting Iberian state did not relax, its view of a peaceful Europe, one without German domination and therefore threat was not yet envisioned, even with Speer's victory. The new Führer was still a national socialist, formerly a devoted, close acolyte of Hitler, one that may talk sense but still a by blood a barbaric German. The idea that Iberia could now relax, possibly even devolve as Salazar hoped for an idealistic future, was not one rooted in the still grotesque reality they had to endure. After initial jubilance even the Portuguese Caudillo became rooted again, adopting his usual composure in the next Council meeting. Invited military and economic analysts began to give estimates, derived from close analysis of Germany's material reality and Speers proposed policies, of how long it would take Germany to rebuild and what sort of military capabilities the Iberians would need to prepare for in a worst case scenario. Caudillo Franco, unusually for the aging fighter, was very invested in this meeting, interrupting regularly to ask specific questions on military matters. Salazar, spotting Franco taking charge of the situation in a way he did not appreciate in the slightest began to make equally valid statements on the political and diplomatic motivations Speer may follow, trying to reduce the push for further Iberian military expansion as he viewed this as being an unjustified, aggressive move, one that may produce negative reaction. Underneath his open reasoning, he also was motivated to try to reduce the further integration of the two nations this would create. Surprisingly, the Council took Franco's side in this matter, the final decision of the Council being to prepare for a worst case possibility, to better be safe than sorry. Salazar retched internally once he left the meeting."

 IBR.106.d:0 "A lone seagull, high up in the pure sea of white clouds, listened to its primal instincts and dove further down to try to spot some possible prey. Instead it was greeted with the unusual sight of a rather large contingent of the Iberian navy, both Portuguese and Spanish ships conducting a large scale exercise, a show of strength personally overseen by Caudillo Franco from the shore. The brutish Spaniard had secured this personal vanity project out of his Portuguese counterpart in the recent debate over the Iberian response towards the victory of the liberal reformer Speer in the German Civil War. Salazar, quite fond of the his navy himself, had quickly recognized that the Germans would take little notice of this waste of precious fuel, their attention mainly focused inwards at this moment, any of their little foreign policy decision being in regards to their subjects around the world, and therefore granted his fellow Caudillo's request without much opposition. He needed Franco grateful and ready to compromise with him on more important issues regarding the new diplomatic scene of Europe, but the training also showed him the Portuguese naval capacity, which he also inspected closely from his comfortable viewing platform standing next to Franco. It after all was vital to rebuild the empire he had lost to the marauding Teutons, who it seems now might be finally tamed from their destructive nature."

 IBR.107.d:0 "The Pyrenees Mountains, an immense, natural defensive line that once had split the peninsula from the feared French, now divided Iberia away from a Europe ruled by a far greater evil. Or so it would seem for anyone watching the sunburnt manual labourers and military men toiling away endlessly, using man's great ingenuity to further expand the large fortifications that lined the beautiful mountain range on the southern French border. Again the Iberian Council had voted for Franco's gruffly made proposal that had led to the constructions, to the deep and bitter chagrin of Salazar who was getting more impatient with Franco's defensive demands each new meeting. The Spaniard did not seem to run out of ideas. So far the intelligence services had reported nothing that could suggest Speer had untoward desires when it came to Iberia and its peoples. Whether that would change with each new military venture that Franco departed on was yet to be seen. In all honesty, Salazar was not entirely against the fortress installations being built, yet for different reasons to the Spanish Caudillo. He saw a great threat emitting from the former German puppet of Burgundy, the secretive SS state. Any kind of defense against this ominous threat was a welcome one indeed. He therefore has not vetoed this idea either."

 IBR.108.d:0 "In the ever worsening personal conflict between the two contrasting Caudillos over the official Iberian government policy towards the new Reich, the traditional statesman and politician Salazar had finally been able to wrangle a significant concession out of the aging former general. Drawing upon all the previous plans and projects from the Spanish Caudillo that he had not vetoed for the sake of an opportunity like this, the old Portuguese convinced the Spaniard that even if the government's policy will follow one of caution toward the wobbling European hegemon, we should not allow the Germans to see any aggression in our handling of state affairs. Following another debate, this time more of a monologue as Franco had lost interest, it was decided that diplomacy would be initiated with the new regime in Germania, diplomacy on mutual necessity. In other words trade and commerce. It would allow a channel of communication in the possibility of crisis. Through this change in policy it might also be possible to expand the intelligence network we are still building in the ruined country, to ascertain the direction and working of the German government, but for Salazar more importantly it could allow a thawing of previously frozen relations between the two European nations. Like usual, Franco had not been able to object to the ascetic statesman when he had begun his rant. He saw no real danger in pursuing what Salazar proposed but deemed it not useful enough for Iberia, the nation needed a threatening external force to unite against. Looks like he might have to create a new enemy."

 IBR.112.d:0 "Mateo woke up choking. Fluttering with the panic of a nightmare, he exploded from his horizontal position into a vertical one, standing upright and grasping at his throat with all of the instinct of a wild gazelle. As the vestiges of sleep left him, and consciousness returned to reign, he removed his hand from his neck and remembered what was caught in his throat. It was the silence. He was all alone in the Palacio de la Bolsa de Madrid, and it was silent among the marble pillars and stained glass and stock ticker and rotary phones all left off the hook. Mateo, for his part, had fallen asleep slumped in some obscure corner of the trading floor. With a building horror, he began to remember the events of the last few hours.\n\nAt 10 a.m., open outcry begins. There is clear panic in the shouts of many traders as they desperately unload stocks, a panic that seems utterly unfounded in Mateo's eyes. The recent government economic plan has seemingly been effective, and while the markets were shaky, they were trending upwards. Mateo decided against giving into the panic, deciding instead to buy the dip. At about 10:30 a.m., it became clear that the dip was not going to correct, or even slow. Open outcry will last for several more hours while the \"dip\" builds inertia, like a stone chucked down a deep well, reverberating as it hits the walls, becoming more and more undeniable.\n\nEventually, the pressure breaks him. Mateo, fearing further downturn, sells a huge number of Rumasa shares. Après lui, le déluge. The building crescendo of fear and doubt breaks like a wave as Mateo slams into the fray of the trading pit. All of the other traders on the sidelines join in, and what breaks out is more anthropological than financial. It is an unmitigated disaster; it is nature, red in tooth and blood. As every trader in Madrid becomes desperate to sell, open fights break out on the trading floor as government men desperately attempt to shut down trading, but it is too late. Iberia is thrust from shaky economic rebuilding to true economic collapse. Mateo slowly slouches back down onto the cool marble wall. There is nothing for him here anymore, but there very well may not be anything for him at home either."

José Manuel de Mello of the Companhia União Fabril, a true conglomerate, and the Portuguese answer to the Zaibatsu. António Champalimaud, one of the richest men in Iberia, his fortune derived from clever investments and a near monopoly on the cement industry. Américo Amorim, head of the namesake Corticeira Amorim, a leading cork conglomerate. Alexandre Soares dos Santos, CEO of the retail company Jerónimo Martins. José Sirvent, president of the National Institute of Industry. Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, the head of Renfe-Operadora, the national rail conglomerate, and a man with political ambitions. Antonio Barrera de Irimo, the leader of Telefónica, the national telecommunications company. Finally, leading the pack, José María Ruiz-Mateos, leader of Rumasa, a holding company that makes up nearly 2% of the entire Iberian economy. Either a group of intelligent entrepreneurs, or heartless robber barons depending on who you asked. The young bureaucrat didn't care enough to have an opinion either way.\n\nThe economic leaders settled into their seats, with death on their faces. They believed that this was the moment of crackdown. This was the moment where they would be informed that due to the increasing economic crisis, their companies would be wrested from them. In the face of Franco and Salazar, they could do nothing but silently comply. The young bureaucrat began to speak with a solemn and apologetic tone.\n\n\"You are the leaders of this nation's economy. You have served this nation well, and built your companies to be the pillars of Iberia, and should you fail now, the nation would fail. It is for this reason that I remind you all to conduct yourself with the utmost care. Please, as you continue employing millions of Iberians, do not let them down. Ensure that you hold up the sky as firmly as Atlas.\" The businessmen looked around, confused. They were being let off? Madrid hadn't discovered their corruption, their book cooking?

Political blocs from across the Union, both great and small, have ensured that their representation within the assembly will be at an absolute maximum. It is time for this landmark assembly of the Iberian Council to commence.\n\nThe assembly opens with the usual legislative formalities, and a quorum is called without a hitch. Shortly thereafter, the Caudillos make their appearance in an awkward tandem as they address the Council. The two leaders engage the Council with tall talk of prosperity and national greatness.

Our chosen partners of trade have all but forsaken us, and our abhorrent protectionism impedes any recovery in trade. We dare to attempt to solve our economic concerns alone, but we are failing! Gentlemen, the way forward is clear; we alone cannot solve the economic question.

Other elements of the Council, however, remain less than enthused. Loud jeers erupt from opposing wings, and many members shout obscenities towards the opposing side. The commotion finally dies down following several calls to order, and the proceedings resume. The Opus Dei continues to put forward detailed plans of economic liberalization, free trade, and a market economy.

The lone source for our current disaster is the Iberian reliance upon foreigners to protect our nation and to protect our economy. This must end! This can end! Iberia's path to greatness lies inward! We alone shall be the masters of our economic destiny, not the profiteering foreign fat cats!\"\n\nThe assembly hall erupts into a tumultuous roar as nationalist and right wing elements applaud the counter to the liberal ideas. As the excited commotion dies down, the Falangists begin to lay out their plan. With a radical emphasis upon autarky and nationalization, the Falangist proposal outlines an Iberia that relies upon itself and itself only. A nation that possesses near unlimited economic control.

It is decided that, as the two men are unlikely to come to a decision through personal deliberations, the council shall hold a vote to decide upon the topic. Despite the original intent being for the Iberian Council to remain advisory only, giving it the power to vote upon the economic reform remains the only method of decision the Caudillos have left, save for complete capitulation to the other man.

Those sympathetic to the rule of Franco and Caetano wish to actively fund Unión Nacional, through proxies and Swiss bank accounts, to ensure that no other party can match their level of funding. Others have considered using suppression to ensure that no liberal parties can become elected or even become part of a coalition. For these moderates, so long as some kind of conservative party wins, Iberia will be safe and the reforms will be limited.\n\nNaturally, the reformist ideologues have expressed disgust at the thought of illegal funding or suppression of parties and reject the notion that only Unión Nacional can guide this country sufficiently, declaring that only free and fair elections can allow the people of Iberia to choose the direction of their nation democratically."

All of these groups have seen a resurgence since the rallies began, and every day their support grows wider and wider. Many in the Council have expressed disgust at the prospect of a liberal or even a socialist government and have considered a media blackout to halt this momentum and prevent what they see as a red tide poised to sweep the nation. Rural representatives have also expressed support at this measure, wishing to keep leftists and cosmopolitan urbanites as far away from their communities as possible.\n\nThe more optimistic within the Council have stated their opposition to the blackout, believing that they can beat back their political enemies on the merits of their arguments rather than resorting to dirty tricks and backdoor politics."

With enough propaganda in the right places, we could turn the farmer and villager voting blocs away from Alianza Popular and towards the Unión Nacional and potentially secure victory in the election.\n\nThat being said, many of the moderates in the Council have stated their position that an Alianza Popular victory in the election would be satisfactory as we share many of their values.

It was all they could do at this point short of raiding every single building in the city. However, after launching a few more of these raids, it was obvious that they were just falling back into their prior pattern.

Several detonations were visible as the Guardia Civil closed into the location, of which were enough to nearly total several buildings. Given the status of the survivors of the attack, the investigation would have to proceed without their testimony, as they were still recovering from their injuries. It was later found that the power of explosion required to damage the structure of the buildings in the complex was far higher than the ordinance produced - suggesting that another, stronger explosive was used in order to damage the facility. Furthermore, very little of the finished product remained, destroyed or otherwise, leading one to conclude that it was taken en masse.\n\nThe political effect of this destruction was disastrous. With new ammunition and supplies at least one terrorist group has been freshly equipped, and they most likely have shared it with fellow separatists. What's worse is the perception of the government. Made confident by the knowledge that we cannot even defend a munitions complex, many separatist groups have been emboldened to act against us."

Reports indicated that the group had access to weapons considered 'far above their status', almost considered military-grade. In order to finally beat back the CNT forces the army had to be called in to restore order to part of the city. Even though their presence has been beaten back, some hold-outs still remain to be flushed out.\n\nAs was simply part of the fighting protocol, beating back the separatists took a large amount of time and was very costly in collateral damage. No favors have been earned with the population of the city, who resent the naturally unpleasant counter-terrorist tactics.

At an initial examination, there was no correlation between the victims other than being in public and not secure. However, a later look into the case revealed that the victims all shared two common factors - they were in the Iberian administration, and they were all Spanish. As this follows the modus operandi of a Portuguese separatist group, it is safe to assume they were the party at fault.\n\nEven though the culprits are narrowed down and justice is inevitable, the damage they dealt is unavoidable. Many Spanish officials are afraid that they'll be next, and between fearing for their lives and doing their jobs little is being done. The blow to the governmental efficiency is severe, and has greatly diminished productivity."

 IBR.593.t:0 "Portuguese Axencia Headquarters Attacked!"
 IBR.593.d:0 "There has been a regional blackout in the services of the Axencia in northern Portugal. Taking the men entirely by surprise, a terrorist group struck directly at the regional headquarters, using firearms far more powerful than intelligence had suggested. Not only did they have such high-grade weaponry, but they were capable of hiding their firepower from the watching eye of the Axencia, too. Understandably, the agents present were not prepared for a separatist group to strike the anti-separatist forces at their own base of operations. The complex was designed around such an eventuality, and with these pre-built fortifications the separatist defeat was inevitable. They didn't let this stop them, though - the fight they put up was reportedly fierce, with only two or three terrorists not fighting to the death.\n\nIt would be fine if this didn't turn out to be a diversion. An unknown agent allowed a group of separatists access to the facilities, and they made off with records, weaponry, and intelligence. As undercover agents are smothered out and depots raided with the newfound data on them, the Axencia has been busy finding their leaking part. The upper half of Portugal will remain vulnerable until an audit is completed, the loose thread is cut, and new connections are established."
 IBR.593.a:0 "I don't suppose we can't spare some resources from nearby?"
 IBR.594.t:0 "Administration Records Stolen or Destroyed!"
 IBR.594.d:0 "An administrative building, containing many important records and no smaller amount of paperwork, was very nearly wiped clean by a terrorist attack. According to the reports of security guards on-scene, a disturbance was responded to, which turned out to be little more than a large distraction. A struggle had begun in the building they were guarding, which had been infiltrated while a diversion was occurring. Their arrival was too late, as the insurgents had defeated the guards and shockingly massacred the staff. When they were intercepted they were in the process of starting a fire on a pile of documents. Even though the terrorists were defeated once their presence had been identified, the guards lacked the means to put out the fire they had started. When it was put out it had burnt through much of the present paperwork.\n\nThe damage goes without saying. Even though much of the lost documentation can be restored in time, it is time exactly that cannot be spared. Since it was a large amount, it will take a large sum of time to replace it all. The time spent replacing papers is time that cannot be spent fighting off terrorists, and they have taken gleeful notice of the fact."

 ibrterror.1.d:0 "Nigh-on thirty years later, the anarchists of the CNT have finally accepted their defeat. Our ceaseless raids, arrests and other policing actions have proven too much for the treacherous reds, and what few terrorists remain have scattered to the winds.\n\nThis has been our hardest-won victory by far; support for the anarcho-syndicalist movement has never died in Catalonia, giving the traitors no shortage of refuge and material support. The workers of Barcelona were a particularly difficult obstacle to surmount in our pursuit of the CNT, but no task is beyond the capabilities of the AAS.\n\nPerhaps with their armed wing broken, the Catalan anarchists will see the futility of their cause and abandon it for good. The AAS is skeptical, but it is safe to say that one of the largest thorns in our side has finally been removed."

 ibrterror.2.d:0 "The Basques as a whole are a hardy and stubborn people; for those of them who dedicate their lives to rebellion, this is doubly true. The ETA have been far and away the most effective terrorist group active in Iberia, killing hundreds in bombings and armed attacks over the course of their campaign. However, we can now rest easy, as the AAS has finally secured the last of their mountain bases in the Basque Country.\n\nMonths have passed since we began to push back the ETA in earnest. Their martial capabilities almost matched those of the AAS, and it was only with military assistance that the terrorists were defeated in open battle. But for all their ferocity, they lacked the manpower and popular organic support to withstand our relentless assaults.\n\nThough our victory is cause for celebration, there are many questions that remain unanswered; primarily, the question of their material support. The ETA never enjoyed widespread support among the population of their homeland, and the amount of hardware at their disposal was suspiciously high for a terrorist organization. For now, though, perhaps we should be content to sit on our laurels and enjoy peace in the Basque Country."

It was those embers which eventually sparked a raging fire, engulfing the forests and hills of Asturias in an unending campaign of terror.\n\nThat era is now over, however. Bitter old miners and workers were no match for our brave AAS agents. After months upon months of sweeping the land, we can safely say that the BTA is no longer a substantial threat. Sympathizer and isolated cells may remain, but this should be the end of them as a cohesive and effective organization.\n\nNow that they are free from both communist propaganda and the threat of violence, perhaps the mines and factories of the north can return to their usual level of productivity. The birthplace of modern Spain shall prosper in safety once more."

After being driven from their urban hideouts, the FSLP fled into the countryside, taking up refuge in the wild places of the land they sought to 'liberate'. The Portuguese branch of the AAS, however, had studied all their moves and learned their devious tricks. Come the final assault, there was nothing the reds could do to escape justice.\n\nAt long last, the green and red of the Portuguese flag can fly happily alongside that of Iberia. No longer do patriotic workers of the west need to fear being targeted as 'class traitors' and 'collaborators'. With this blow, Portugal is at last free from fear and class conflict."

 IBR.606.d:0 "Passing the new programs for the Autonomous Communities was easy. That was no surprise, of course- they had a majority, enough so that the programs failing would be more of a surprise than their success. Of course, those who were against the new - or perhaps the renewed old - autonomy were a talkative lot. The Francoists had a talent for never shutting up, especially when their military buddies were in earshot. They were definitely in earshot this time, as Adolfo Suarez was forced to discover when he was strongarmed into meeting a representative officer.\n\n\"What the hell were you thinking!?\" The sergeant screamed at him, with a fury Suarez had never seen before. \"Even- Without even what I was sent here for, I want to know what the fuck you were thinking!? Do you want to kill this fucking country?\"\n\nAdolfo, despite how hard he tried to keep a respectable face, was this close to wavering under the pressure placed on him. \"We are the ones killing the country? Trying to keep a hold of the entire thing like all it takes is a paperclip? Don't be mad.\"\n\nThey went on for a while more, in a pointless back-and-forth, before the officer finally gave up.\n\n\"We're never going to see eye-to-eye, so there's no point in continuing.

I can't blame you, but I would like you to understand that your support is very important to getting the support we need. So, the reason you're here is that I would like you to talk to me. Tell me everything you want done, all of your demands, and which are the most important.\"\n\nThe regionalist was incredulous. \"You'll comply with a list of demands if I vouch for you?\"\n\n\"Why else are we here? Our transcriber will note down everything you say, then we'll go over it.\"\n\nEach local leader was a few days after the other. Francisco was handling it himself, and he knew what to do - he would let one sing the praises of the government, pass some legislation, and then face a more trusting leader. At least, they seemed more receptive.\n\nWhen it came time for his side of the deal, he provided. Nothing was intolerable to the military or the party, and the simple concessions won many allies."

They were all sitting similarly, mostly, except for the one speaking. The speaker was a native Basque, one of those who fought for his language during the diarchy, capable of speaking his home tongue far better than anyone else could muster. That was good, since getting someone else to do it would come off poorly.\n\nThe Basque spoke of things that were popular, Carneiro knew, because he had written the speech for just this occasion. He watched the Basque speak of freedom, of liberty, of the right to exist as Basque, not Spanish. Carneiro inhaled on the dramatic pause, held his breath, then exhaled as it moved on to the freedom of language.\n\nWhen the crowd cheered after the fact, he took heart that maybe, just maybe, the whole diarchy could be a bad chapter of history.\n\n\"I can tell you caused this!\" screamed a military official, who had coincidentally been present for the speech. He went to speak more, but Carneiro quickly stepped into his car.\n\n\"Sorry! I'd love to chat but I need to attend to further business!\" The politician drove off with a final comment."

They were to propose, review, and then vote on new provisions to the Constitution.\n\nFernández-Miranda proposed the first amendment of the meeting - a restoration of the old autonomy provisions for the minority areas of Iberia. The restored statutes required no review, and the coalition passed the amendment with a clear majority. In only the time it would take to implement the law, the minority regions would be allowed to exist.\n\nEverything unwanted was shot down in moments, in a meeting that ultimately just accomplished the statutes of autonomy."

 IBR.610.t:0 "Dealing With Agrarian Unrest"
 IBR.610.d:0 "The farmers who populate much of the rural areas of Iberia may be, in some regards, blessed. Regarded as the ideal lifestyle by the Francoists, the farmers of the country were often pandered to. Even during autarky, the effects of which were lessened by their self-sufficient nature, the farmers were pampered and had little reason to support other groups - this continues to today, where they are a secure opposition voting bloc.\n\nThe farmers do not support us, and perhaps this is not entirely unwarranted. We are perceived as an elitist group, the dreadful sort which exclusively supports urban areas (as opposed to the dreadful sort that pandered to rurals before us), and as painful as it is to admit, we are in many ways overly favoring our voting bloc, the urban areas. Even though the way to fix this is fairly obvious, the party is split between three opposing factions on this matter, each supporting a different resolution.\n\nThe first and second groups both wish to effectively buy over the farmers using benefits dedicated to them, though they diverge in what benefits specifically to give. The first wishes to use farming equipment, increasing the effectiveness of the farmers and intending to use that favor to acquire supporters. The second wishes to use less direct means, using subsidies to show that we have not forgotten them. The third, and final, faction does not want to do anything. They argue the farmers are a lost cause, and attempts to buy them would be pointless waste.\n\nWhich idea will the leadership favor?"

 IBR.611.d:0 "There is absolutely no justification for the Axencia Anti-Separatista. The bastard child of Franco's obsession with unity, and the resources to enact it, the agency best exemplifies the evils of the Caudillos. Created with an overwhelming sense of authoritarianism, the Axencia has been used not only to stop separatism but effectively act as a paramilitary in some cases - creating some of the worst incidents to come to Iberia.\n\nThis is no reason to create an enemy out of them. As horrible as working with them is, it is a necessary evil until the time comes where they may be defanged.\n\nFrancisco Balsemao will be sent to meet with the higher echelons of the Axencia. His diplomatic skill, hopefully, will prove a valuable asset in the coming meetings. If he is able to convince the Axencia heads that the country is safe in our hands, then we may find them far less obstructive to our aims."

Do you have a lighter?\" He was handed a lighter, and a cigarette, and took a few moments to cherish a puff. Then he began to speak again. \"Now, let us begin our meeting. I am sure you can understand me through a smoke...\"\n\nThe man proved to be an eloquent speaker, and the dance of words between two men who made the act an art was a sight to behold. The men spoke for around an hour, around which the meeting concluded and both went their separate ways.\n\nHe was sold. Pleased with our moderation, the official was more than willing to put in a good word in the Axencia, for they greatly appreciated our commitment to ensuring the state evolved at a controlled pace. This is a great surprise - they surely know our end goal with them - but it isn't a matter to complain about."

Smoking in the conference room is poor manners.\"\n\n\"As you say,\" Francisco responded. \"Let's get started with the meeting, if you are ready...?\"\n\nThe man was very blunt. He spoke honestly, but he spared nothing for politeness. It was almost respectable, his commitment to curt conversation. He informed Balsemao, in no uncertain terms, that the Axencia was concerned. They were concerned with the progression of the state.\n\n\"It would grow out of control, and swallow the country in bureaucracy and waste,\" the man argued. Even more so, they were scared for their own future. \"Is it unreasonable to want to protect your livelihood?\" Yet.. this meeting was a promising sign. That the government would meet in good faith was very valuable to the man meeting, and he would push the others to give the Unión Republicana a chance, if nothing else."

They are still very much alive and kicking, and one of the places they show themselves the worst is one of the most fundamental parts of our budding democracy. The elections have been tampered with. The Francoists have used their influence to attempt to stilt the results in their favor, and they came far too close to succeeding.\n\nWe don't know where they have sunk their claws in. If the Congress is to stay how it must, then we need to find their roots as soon as possible.\n\nWe will not have an easy time, and if we cannot keep sufficient political capital, then we have no chance of finding them.

Because of all of it, several undoubtedly involved individuals have made very persuasive arguments to stop the investigation.\n\nGiving up will without a doubt stop our efforts here. What's shocking is that this may not even be the worst possible occurrence. We could always just continue on with the investigation, trying even harder to reach the evidence that is surely just out of our grasp, but this would make us dangerous enemies. Were we to bend the rules to keep investigating, the military would view us with far greater suspicion than before, for it sets the precedent for them too.

We are at our status quo, with one important change.\n\nThe investigation has infuriated the military. By bending the rules, the general staff is concerned that the rules might be bent to go after them, too.

Even though their collaborators have tried their hardest to stop the investigation before it could uproot the truth, that same truth is now standing before us. It will no doubt be a great blow to their legacy when we release the proof of their deeds to the public.\n\nEven better than that, the intuition shown in the investigation has cowed the military.

If we have any say on the matter - which we do - that will end today.\n\nAs is the case with every political matter in this country, there is a wealth of options before us on how to handle the municipalities. If we make a show of dealing with these petty tyrants, it may earn us political points with those under their thumbs.

If any of these hardliners are convicted of a crime, then they will lose their special privileges. They have, for certain, committed crimes in their careers.

Though they had been tastefully fit into the design, the hallways had been visibly braced and reinforced. The doors into the main chamber had been replaced with much more secure iron doors. He was stopped by two more guards, checked for his business, and then was inside the chamber. Looking behind him, the doors had been given an emergency bar to use if someone tried to break in. There were several emergency phone lines around the room, for clear purposes. There was only one last place to check - the armory.\n\nSuarez beheld a room of firearms, some already missing from their slots. This was part of the contingency plan, where the House would mobilize a large number of guards.

One of our promises was to unban these leftist groups, securing their support in creating a new Iberia. Now that we are in power, they expect us to make good on our promises and unban them.\n\nIt would be very easy - just a few strokes of a pen - to do so, but the political ramifications would be severe. If we let the Communists into the government, then it could send the military into a panic. Usually, making the one with a gun panic is a bad idea..

Of course, they may just peter out if we don't address them.\n\nIf we were to walk back on our commitment to keeping them banned, it would be a catastrophic loss of face. We would not only be promise-breakers, but seen as spineless as well. We could not entirely unban them safely. There could be a compromise, however. If we were to unban the less-revolutionary groups.

It's hard to tell if the previous regime even tried to monitor what happened in those prisons, as abuses and violations of rights were so common that it created a reputation for brutality. Franco would simply throw a dissident into the prison and let them die - which was far from an impossible occurrence. We cannot let people be incarcerated in such conditions anymore.\n\nThe best way to lessen the issue immediately is to remove the people committing these atrocities. There are many problematic guards, used to not facing consequences for their actions, as well as those who are so adept at torture that they are better called torturers. If we arrested them all, then we could stop many abuses that could happen. However, we may upset the military by being indiscriminate, which could be dangerous.

Since it is far from an ideal world, some tact will be required.\n\nThe commander of the prison was largely left to his own devices by Franco, and attempting to chafe on that autonomy may anger him. Since he is in a fortified location, out at sea, with plenty of provisions, his anger would be an incredible blow to an already unpopular decision - for Franco made sure to intertwine his brutality with Iberian pride.

There must not be a siege, so there are only two options to end this charade: A surgical strike, and the unthinkable. A squad of soldiers may be able to apprehend the commander before he can fortify, sending the pyramid tumbling down. However, if they fail, then the consequences will be truly severe.

If we intentionally probe lightly with the investigation, it could open up negotiations and help ease relations - provided they trust us still.\n\nWe must be decisive, remain committed to our choice, and remember that we will not get a second chance at this.

Do you have a list, or should we take it from the top?\"\n\nHaving brought in a receptive bunch, Balsemao was pleased to learn that the military, too, was relieved by the prospect of talking things over.

 IBR.622.d:0 "A country like Iberia is hardly the place for a liberal-oriented party. Having been under the tight leash of a regime - two, arguably - which sought to eliminate all political opposition, nearly every echelon of society is staffed with despots, lackeys, and yes men seeking to maintain their power no matter what. For a party like ours, who wishes to move beyond this dark era, these men are often dangerous and unwavering enemies. To throw away help in a situation like this is to prepare our noose.\n\nOur help is, to put it diplomatically, whoever we can find. There are still many moderates in Iberian politicians. Whether they are veterans who have cooled over the years or young dissidents, it does not matter. If we can secure these connections, then defeating the Francoists will be much simpler."

We have learned from insider information that many of these veterans are skeptical of our policies, opposing its implementation for one reason or another.\n\nAre they still worth trying to court? If we were to make concessions, there are fair odds they would go along with the show of cooperation. This asks another question, though: How much is their support worth?

The charade probably would have continued indefinitely until someone decided enough was enough. All these dealings were leaked to the media.\n\nSwooping in like birds of prey, the media outlets exposed our dealings to the rest of the country, and more importantly towards those we tried to reach. We are like a joke to them now - who would work with a party when there was only one spine between them? So thoroughly compromising our values for the sake of support seems to have also alienated some among our own, too."

The moderate veterans, the best-aged segment of Franco's regime, have seen us as a worthy cause. With due note to their collective opportunism - if we were not elected they would not give us the time of day - it was very easy to create an effective and comprehensive political alliance. It is certainly a great step up for our power, but should we really show it?\n\nWe could announce our new alliance publicly, as a way of showing the military that we are not to be trifled with. It could cow them, but it might also do just the opposite if it is handled poorly.

Instead of silencing the military, the speech seems to have made them more talkative! They speak of intervention, concern, and of \"proclaiming our dishonest motives\"...

They did not surrender with the rest of their troops, and still desire to return to menace us. We must deal with them, as only their capture can totally put this treason to rest.

Unfortunately, our military being what it is, most of them have deserted us to join the fascists. It is a fact of human history that some things never change, and it looks like the old Spanish habits will die hard.

 IBR.5400.d:0 "It has become obvious to the government, given the oil crisis afflicting the nation, that it is imperative that an oil rationing system needs to be put in place following our inability to import enough oil for the excessive demand. While there have been prominent voices within the opposition detailing their problems with an oil rationing system and how it might affect the ability of firms to manufacture goods that require oil, the government intends to press on, in order to make sure everyone has at least some oil and oil based products for their day to day lives.\n\nWhat the government has not decided on, is how strict this rationing should be. The first proposal has been a very harsh rationing system to thoroughly ensure that the country does not run out what little oil it has left in its reserves. However, some members of the cabinet have stated their hesitation with the measure warning that it is too strict and could cause the government's approval to tank considering the central oil has in both people's daily lives and the economy as a whole."

 IBR.5401.d:0 "While the New Economic Program is centered around the need to address the working people of this nation, some measures will be needed to address the inflation that occurs when utilizing stimulus spending to offset this economic crisis. It is for this reason, that the government has seen fit to raise interest rates in order to curtail consumer and business spending. While this will impede the economy's ability to grow, the threat of rising inflation and even potentially hyperinflation means that it is something that has to be endured if the government's plan to weather the storm is to succeed.\n\nIn spite of this, our in-house economists are divided on how much to raise interest rates with the two main camps based around raising the rates from 6% to either 9% or 15%. The proponents of the former increase state that raising them too high will paralyze the country's economy and make spending so unlikely that the economy will continue to plummet whereas the proponents of the latter claim that 9% wouldn't impede spending enough to cause inflation to decrease claiming that the average Iberian would soon their currency become useless. Both arguments could lead the country down a road of economic ruin and by extension, an unmitigated defeat in the next election so we have to pray to both God and Keynes that the right decision is made here."

The question of debt repayment begins with who we intend to pay back, as there is substantial debt from both domestic and international lenders who both want their money plus interest back as soon as possible.\n\nOne thing that cannot be ignored is that the government must pay back the debt from the domestic lenders due to the fact that ignoring them would be political suicide and would weaken the government's credibility with small and large businesses operating in Iberia. However, whether the government can afford to pay back the foreign debt still remains up in the air, as the means by which we could afford to pay them back would certainly require a further tax hike which would be immensely unpopular and further inhibit our economic growth. That being said, a refusal to pay these international lenders back would result in eroded confidence from foreign firms and an even bigger bill when we are in a situation to pay them back due to the interest that will have accrued."

It is important that we remember that we cannot leave this recession unless all peoples of Iberia have been raised up and no longer go hungry, no longer be forced to live paycheck to paycheck, no longer be punished for the mistakes the top 1% make.\"\n\nWhile the members of the \"top 1%\" didn't seem to like Fernández-Miranda's TV speech, the \"average Iberian\" seemed to love it and the Unión Republicana has seen a steady increase in the polls as a result of it. The mixture of presenting hope for the future with populist messaging about the rich has really struck a chord with the working class and rallies in the urban areas since the speech have seen a dramatic increase in turnout.

I know my voice will arrive in your residence being constantly interrupted by my tears and constant sobbing; it is natural to feel this way the tremendous pain his absence brings to us. It is a moment of extreme sadness, but we must not become hopeless, it is true that Franco, our Caudillo for so many years, is not among us but he left us his work, his example and the fulfillment of a historic duty. I was witness of his last day of work, when Death had already taken her toll at his heart and I can guarantee you that this was his last message to the people he loved so much:\n\nNow that the time is near for me to stand in judgment before God Almighty, I ask that He look kindly upon me since I have striven to live and to die as a good Catholic. It has always been my desire to be a faithful son of the church, I ask forgiveness from all, as I give my most heartfelt forgiveness to those who declared themselves my enemies. I believe and hope that had no enemies other than those who were enemies of Iberia. Iberia, which I will love until the last moment and which I promised to serve until my dying breath, which is near. Do not forget that the enemies of Iberia and of Christian civilization are watching, and you should also be watchful and should lay aside all personal gain in favor of the goals and interests of our homeland and of the Iberian people. Continue striving to obtain social justice and education for all Iberians and make use of the rich multiplicity of its regions as a fountain of strength for a continued united Iberia. I would like in these, my last moments, to join the names of God and Iberia, and for us all to embrace one another and to shout for the last time on the threshold of my death - Arriba Ibéria!\""

 IBR.633.d:0 "The minorities of Iberia are the nastiest of them all. With frightening dedication, the secessionists are the greatest threat the Union could ever face. At their worst they are able to create 'red zones', isolated pockets of extreme activity. While these red zones are essentially massive targets that are stomped out just as quickly as they appear, it serves as a great example of how unpleasant they can be. For the sake of stability these occurrences need to be reduced or even stopped.\n\nInitially, the plan was just to simply channel it towards foreigners. There was an issue with this, though, and it was that we didn't have any plan beyond 'point them at the outsiders'. So we put our best minds at the Axencia to it, and after laboring day and night they presented a more in-depth plan. All that remains is to put the plan into effect, and watch them flock to our banner."

 IBR.634.d:0 "We must integrate the minorities into Spanish society. It is the only way, or else we will be prey to eternal terrorism and destabilization from the more radical elements of their people. Minority cultures must die. The first step is to eliminate their language. Only Castilian will be taught in schools, and local media will never use local languages. Like Franco's policies, total immersion in the language coupled with allowing no further instruction of minority language will kill it off until everyone speaks Castilian or Portuguese. After that comes the second phase, where the differences between Castilian and the minority cultures will be slowly eroded until they are the same. Then, no matter what they say they are, they will be Spanish. There's an issue and it's obvious: this will cause a lot of anger. The policies aren't negotiable so it's necessary to find another way to quell most of the unrest.\n\nAnd a contingency plan is exactly what's planned. Should the minorities get too uppity then we'll arrange a meeting with several leaders of their community, and offer them some apparent 'guaranteed rights and privileges' in exchange for them publicly denouncing any separatist forces. What we'll fail to mention is that there is a loophole or an override for all of these, rendering them moot. By then, it'll be too late to object to them."

There's little consensus on just how wide the window of separatism truly is. The dispute got so bad that eventually De Valcárcel had to step in and set the policy based on his own views on the matter. Coincidentally, his opinions happened to be the harshest of them all.\n\nUnder the new legal definition, separatism extends far beyond simple terrorism. Now, anyone found to be so much as sympathizing with separatists can be charged with the same crimes as the terrorists themselves! That is to say nothing of what now legally constitutes separatism. All that needs to be done is send the new laws to the Axencia Anti-Separatista and direct them to arrest those who had slipped through the cracks previously."

 IBR.636.d:0 "The Caudillos were very careful to cultivate a strongly positive public image. In every minute they were revealing themselves to the people they put on an aura of authority and morality - it really looked like they were entirely ready for both their job and working with each other. The idea of two benevolent guardians was able to tame many into obedience, and not having to take action against as many people only served to reinforce the image of kindness, which in turn led to more obedience, and so on. Over time this image has fallen to the wayside because nobody was willing to use it. It's time that we place it back into Iberian society, as it should be.\n\nTo the populace we will portray ourselves as the successors to the Caudillos. We will claim the legacy of the benevolent protectors, and extract what loyalty we can out of that. After all, we are the new Caudillos, following in the steps of the previous ones; and if you followed the old ones why wouldn't you follow us too?"

The thesis will be particularly targeted at the clergy, who will be able to get the ideas out to more people better than we could. Within the thesis we will begin by elaborating on the definition of 'Western Civilization', and how it is founded on Christian values. Through this we can explain how Iberia, a western civilization, is also founded on these Christian values. From here we shall proclaim that the Union will fall into barbarity and chaos without these values. It will be elaborated on what they are: charity, chastity, and obedience for your highers. The three pillars, the fundamentals of any good moral society. It will be a call to all who read it to maintain and spread these values everywhere they go, and to become the paragons of Christianity by following them."

 IBR.638.d:0 "Back in the days of the Caudillos, they used total immersion in propaganda to more effectively persuade people. If there was no other view, then the only perspective would eventually beat you down into accepting it. There was only one issue to this, and it was that it took a very fine level to achieve the desired results. Too much, and you risked apathy. Too little, and you could let some unapproved material slip through the cracks. But not to worry, as the people who worked this before are still around now. Even better, most of them have come to work for us. All we need to do is let the experts run free, and before we know it we'll have the people twisted around our fingers. After all, if anyone can replicate the success of the past, it would have to be the people who enabled it. They will be provided all they need, and a bit more, to make sure any dissidents are relegated to the fringe."

 IBR.639.t:0 "Instigating National Fervor"
 IBR.639.d:0 "Propaganda is only one thing, and if it's all you use you'll never get anywhere in your doings. For maximum efficiency there needs to be a drop of truth, or even better a gallon of hatred. In order to really coax an Iberian identity it is necessary that one of the two are utilized. In this case, it would be better to pour on the hate. Then, it can be capitalized on. Find a scapegoat, give them plenty of blame, or make someone look scary, then talk about how you need the military to keep things in order. Emphasize the armed forces, ensure people know how necessary they are. Regardless, with the emphasis on things you can blame, you can more effectively rally people around opposing said thing.\n\nIt is still trivial to assign some incident from a foreign power as an act of malice. Then, once it is established there is a threat, the nation can be whipped up into a frenzy. By using some limited hyperbole to get the desired effect, hate can be channeled away from the state. Because all of their discontent is aimed at someone else they will be far more willing to listen to their betters. While it is unsavory these tactics are necessary to make sure people properly respect authority. The success of this program is already a given, so everything that needs to be done is to set it into motion."

Even worse, they allow for fools and despots to navigate their power, enslaving everyone who dared help them. For their sake, we must stop this ideology where we can. From here on out, all hives of this dangerous thought will be rooted out and removed from Iberia. More importantly, we will be able to rally the populace in opposition to leftism.\n\nWhat is remarkable about the destruction of socialism in Iberia is that it is one of the few things the upper echelons of the party are in total consensus on. They all want it gone, entirely, as soon as possible. The entirety of the Unión Nacional was united in one goal:"

Thankfully this time the situation resolved itself quickly enough to ensure de Valcárcel did not intervene. The first most important step to removing leftism is to destroy their influence in politics. But how? They clearly must be arrested for their harmful beliefs, but there is no valid cause that they may be arrested for. At least, that we know of. That we might not know about some of their doings - of which could be grounds for arrest - was enough to pique the attention of several party members. The next move was already a certainty. The opposition would be investigated, their socialist and separatist ties revealed, and their members arrested. While the circumstances to enable such a move are contrived and tenuous at best, they are necessary to keep Iberia safe."

Much like an organism, the state is comprised of many lesser parts who, all together, create something far greater than each other separate. Nowhere is this more true than Iberia, where several regions come together to form a greater whole. Much like an organism, however, there cannot be room for deviation. All parts must perform their dedicated function, and allowing anything to stray from their role will hamper the function of the whole. This school of thought is one that needs to be applied to all levels of government, and until it is accepted by the people it must be hammered into their heads that they ought to hush up about their grievances, and allow the dedicated leadership organ to do their job, just as they ought to do theirs."

 IBR.643.d:0 "A truly moral society is one based on her religion. In order to have a strong union we must lean on our traditions, and the faith is the strongest of all traditions. Therefore, Catholicism should be raised up, and injected into Iberian society. Thankfully there is a pre-established doctrine for placing religion as a main pillar of daily life. The value of the common good above all else is paramount. If one focuses on the individual, then they will neglect the whole to the detriment of the common good.\n\nOf course we lack the support to properly put this into effect. In order to move things along we will need to rely on support outside of our party. Due to their ideological proximity we will discuss the matter with some of the more malleable members of the Alianza Popular. In order to secure the success of the Catholic social doctrine the party must be convinced. Without their support, it will not be possible to achieve our goals."

 IBR.644.d:0 "No-one could ever deny that morality and piety are critical to the national health of Iberia. However, simply posing these as the end-all be-all of the nation's well being could not be farther from the truth. Any state is tied to their economy, and the prosperity of one spurs the prosperity of the other.\n\nAt least, that is how it should be. Unfortunately, 'should' is frequently replaced with something else. A privatized economy is a good example of something that is anything other than 'should'. Iberia has the right to her own destiny and self-determination. With the corporations of foreign people in charge of her economy, the Union lacks that self-determination, since it cannot exercise sovereignty over every bit they ought to. Therefore, a new system needs to be put in place. Every segment of the economy will be placed under the control of a corporate block, who will then operate it for the common good.\n\nThis matter is undoubtedly unpopular, despite its benefit. Without the support of the Alianza Popular, the corporatist system has no chance of success. Therefore discussions will be held in order to convince the other party that this system will be something worth supporting. Their success is critical."

Since our power is secure it is our solemn duty to change that.\n\nThe people of Iberia are held back by the deceptions and so they must be changed. The first truth is that the Caudillos weren't the best for either Spain or Portugal. Everyone knows that, but it is more nuanced than that. Like it or not they were stabilizing figures, and this fact needs to be represented in history. Equally so is the depiction of the empires that preceded Iberia. They aren't given a fair chance, and their qualities - such as their abilities to civilize and bring holiness to savages - are sorely missed.\n\nWhile only a sample of the sweeping reforms that are necessary to properly show the Union's history, it needs to be mentioned how monumental this project is. Once the new curriculum is fully written, it will be printed into new textbooks, and sent off to every school free of charge. After that it is only a matter of time."

Sleep had nearly consumed him, but he would not let it until he knew what he was going to do.\n\nLate at night was hardly an apt time to consider matters of state, but there was simply no time to do it elsewhere. There was one thing on the man's mind: their political career. No matter what they did, where they did, it was always blocked by the opposition! Even when they weren't doing it the Alianza Popular made sure to stick their noses in too. Nothing got done, and nothing could be done! A rage was boiling up from the party leader's depths, but he bit it down.\n\nPiecing together a solution only took a few minutes. If the opposition always got in the way... then they'd need to be shoved out of the way, or better yet ran over. As a draft was drawn up and plans were born, Valcárcel's expression went from anger, to smugness, to excitement.\n\nThe scribble of pencil continued all through the night.

The arguments from this have varied from their draconic nature to the inability to feasibly execute them. What they have not seemed to consider is that, by the new laws, this is also separatism.

So many people have been arrested in such a short amount of time that we cannot keep up with it. There is an overwhelming number of prisoners to process, trials to be held, and legal challenges to bat down. All these issues will be sorted, and the initial wave of arrests will eventually die down, but it will take time.

Once more suspects were arrested we moved higher up, going from random people to more important figures who now lacked a support base to back them. The convicted separatists were able to cause quite a stir among the public, who now organize campaigns of disobedience against us in retaliation.

Many members are afraid that they would be next in a chain of assassinations, and the attitude has had a negative impact on productivity. Instead of doing their job, some members are more concerned with obsessively securing themselves in the event of an attempted killing.

Leaders of minority communities have all squarely refused to negotiate, taking stances that vary from neutrality to outright support of what they consider 'just' resistance against Iberia. Given the substantial influence these figures hold within their communities, combined with the integration policies, supporting separatists is far easier to swallow for most. Even worse, more have taken on the mantle of freedom fighter in an attempt to \"liberate\" their people."

Nothing stands out of the ordinary, except for a pile of textbooks in the middle of a field. A man pours a canister of liquid over them, and another strikes a match. In the dim light the textbook covers are visible - they're in Castilian. The second man tosses the match into the pile, and they both step back. As the flames lick at the air they reveal an entire group, objects in hand. One at a time they all toss what they're holding into the flames - newspapers, more textbooks, all sorts of media. After the last object falls into the greedy embrace of the fire the bunch stop a moment more to admire their handywork, then flee off into the darkness of the country.\n\nOf course, these sorts of incidents proved to be just too much to stomach for most of the leaders of the minority communities. Coaxing them into a negotiation to bring it all to an end was a simple matter. The verbal back-and-forth, plotted out by the National Union, ended with the intended response: the participating minority leaders condemned the actions of their separatists, and in return rights and privileges were guaranteed by the government. By the time they had realized these wouldn't mean anything, the damage had been done. The calls for compliance echoed louder than the cries of betrayal, and so many who would have before resisted instead found it easier to cooperate."

 IBR.656.d:0 "In every region of Iberia, the so-called 'Principles of Christian Civilization' and their ideas were spread to the populace. For the most part, they were conveyed through priests, preaching these moral ideals to those of their audience that would listen. Though not universally followed by priests, many were willing to oblige the Principles. Their intended message was simple and because of that it was simple to work it into something else.\n\nEven through all of this the Principles simply weren't enough. They simply lacked the longevity to stick with those receptive to the idea, a group outnumbered by the group that wasn't. A lasting impression only developed among only a small few. A religious incentive to not rock the boat was simply not going to be, and forcing the issue would only make things worse. So, the Principles passed on as a barely-remembered memory."

Though not universally followed by priests, many were willing to oblige the Principles. Their intended message was simple and because of that it was simple to work it into something else.\n\nThis was far more disastrous than even the worst-case scenarios imagined. In a public statement a clique of key Alianza Popular figures condemned the ideas contained within the Principles, decrying them as a 'lamentable perversion of religion' and even outright calling it 'francoist in nature'. While this proclamation had little effect on those already not in favor of the mandate, to those who thought something of it this was a very effective turnoff. At the urging of the Alianza Popular the more religiously minded of Iberia found themselves a bit less trusting of their ruling government, as a state that was so willing to pervert the meaning of the faith was not their state at all."

Their ultimate message - respect your betters - was one that stayed with a lot of people, and to the faithful the religious call for obedience happened to be one they were unwilling to ignore. Under the guise of being a core part of Christianity, there now existed a new justification for the National Union's doings. Coincidentally, it quickly became a favorite argument for its supporters."

 IBR.659.d:0 "It is a chilly morning in Lisbon. But the inclement weather didn't seem to stop a crowd from turning up. Gathered in front of a government building, a cluster of individuals especially stood blocking the way into the building. When an official or a clerk tried to make their way inside someone moved over to stop them. This continued for what felt like an eternity as morning turned to day and only got warmer. Finally, the police arrived. Though some appeared sluggish and reluctant the law enforcement agents did their duty and dispersed the crowds. While functions were able to continue on after that, the damage had been done. Half the day had been wasted by protestors, and function was crippled for a substantial time after.\n\nThis was not the only city this occurred in. Every major city (and some minor too) in the Union had a similar rally, as protestors blocked off government functions as best they could for as long as they could. The emphasis on military and its necessity caused a large amount of discontent, and so the average citizen was just a little bit less trusting of their government."

 IBR.660.t:0 "Massive Protests Against The Investigation!"
 IBR.660.d:0 "Over the course of our crusade to root out bolshevism, dissent has spread to every area of government. Everywhere that we do not directly control has been victim to some sort of agitation or discontent from more foolish souls. Falling under the socialist falsehood that the investigation is not in their best interests, multiple figures in the Congress have spoken out against it, declaring it 'unjustified'. This sentiment has gradually diffused into the general populace, sparking dissent and outrage everywhere it goes. Sadly it appears an uproar has already been whipped up and so citizens have began a series of rallies and protests against the investigation into the political left-wing.\n\nThe mass of objectors have one demand: the immediate cessation of the investigation. As there are a large amount of people who have made their opposition vocal folding to their demands is an entirely possible option. Of course, it is also possible to simply send in the Guardia Civil to force them to disperse. The action will not be popular but against law enforcement agents they will be forced to comply."

 IBR.661.t:0 "Populace Views Investigation As Anti-Democratic"
 IBR.661.d:0 "Our previous actions taken to ensure the investigation to its natural conclusion have borne long-term consequences. Crackdowns and forced dispersals have only made the affair less popular with the population. Even worse, it has given a more convincing excuse to call the investigation off. The argument espoused by leftist mouthpieces is that, since it causes enough to force a police presence, it clearly isn't that democratic. The crowd who wishes to oppose us no matter what we do has latched on to this and parroted it to no end.\n\nSince any protest against the action is shut down by the Guardia Civil not long after it begins, we can simply keep on as planned. Public outrage is nothing new, and it will subside with time. Alternatively it would be simple to just call the investigation off. A move like that could save face among elements of the public and would in effect be cutting our losses."

They already had their reprisals planned, statements prepared, and many had gleefully marked the day down as a day deserving celebration. Every party member, then, was astonished when they discovered that there was nothing to accuse their opposition guilty of. Not even the tiniest violation - they had run an exemplary campaign.\n\nIt wouldn't do. The public reaction - all that for nothing - would be horrible. In these moments of unfiltered desperation, a plan was concocted; if there was nothing to be found, then something would need to be 'found'. This idea was very popular among the party, but simply calling it a day never fell out of favor. The ensuing argument was one of the most rancorous to strike the party, but in the end they decided..."

Guardia Civil agents are growing weary of the constant deployments and tensions have been equally growing explosive. Some more worried individuals consider it only a matter of time until something horrific occurs. Others think that things will work out just fine. After all, they have been so far, surely.

 IBR.664.d:0 "A crowd had gathered in Barcelona, undoubtedly for another protest. This occasion proved itself different once the police arrived to disperse them. Expecting a group that would leave once asked a bit firmer than nicely, the Guardia Civil were caught entirely by surprise when the people started responding with violence. As time went on a questionable response caused things to only get worse. The Barcelona Incident, as it was later called, was really set in motion by a perfectly positioned car bomb. When the situation escalated the Guardia Civil were caught even more by surprise and were nearly entirely forced out of Barcelona by rioting citizens. What was most devastating about the whole affair, however, was that the law enforcement was humiliated. Unable to entirely contain the situation in a timely manner, they instead were forced to cordon the affected areas off and choke off the riot.\n\nIt appears this wave of unrest stemmed from the accusations levied towards the more left-wing politicians, which were flawed and easily debunked. The idea of evidence being faked in such a fashion seemed only to enrage the population, laying the groundwork for today's tragedy."
 IBR.664.a:0 "Well isn't that just great?"

While the post-breakup mumbling and grumbling lasted for far longer than typical, nobody appeared willing to go further than that. Even that eventually died down and then the day became little more than a memory. Worse, it was considered by most to be nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nOutside of the frontlines, incidents had occurred that could almost be considered optimal. The Axencia discovered a group of Catalonian terrorists planning to incite violence by detonating a bomb during the rally in Barcelona. Thanks to some 'convenient' and legitimate appearing documents, the attempting bombing was able to be tied to the more leftist areas of Iberian politics. To anyone who doesn't dig too deep, it really does appear that they supported the separatists."

 IBR.667.d:0 "The reaction to the imposement of the organic doctrine has been one of bewilderment, to put it lightly. Only a small, more conservative segment of the population agreed with our ideals and it grew in no way but worse from there. The typical reaction was that of confusion of some form - many just simply didn't see a rhyme or reason to the new political theory. Another small segment of the populace took active hostility against the doctrine. Seeing a 'malicious pattern' in what it attempted to convey led to them opposing it everywhere they found it. To both extremes it was a matter of harsh contention, but the majority didn't think anything of it either way. Even though it wasn't the intended response, it is a small consolation that it was not any worse than it was."

 IBR.668.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Catholic social doctrine is not to be. After showcasing the doctrine, discussing the proposal, and allowing the Alianza Popular to deliberate, they have decided by a narrow margin that they do not wish to support it. While their reason for being dissuaded from the idea was initially unclear, by information from loyalists within the AP a prevailing attitude was that it seemed overwhelmingly Francoist in nature. Unfortunately, without their full support the doctrine is dead. Even though it would likely be possible to compromise on a neutered version of the proposal doing so would render it pointless. Though it is true that there are some, namely the loyalists, would vote in favor of the measure anyway, they are insignificant. Without the full support of the Alianza Popular there is no meaningful version of the doctrine that could realistically be passed."

 IBR.669.d:0 "After utilizing the 'loyalists' to aid bringing the matter to the Alianza Popular, they have - by a narrow margin - decided to place the party's support behind our proposal. According to one present, the doctrine was discussed for a long while, and then it was placed to a vote. The prevailing concern among the AP was the 'Francoist' nature of the proposal, but this seemed to not play large enough of a part to significantly influence the outcome.\n\nThe importance of this support cannot be understated. This initial support sets the foundation for a trend that can be capitalized upon later on. Additionally, this means that we are able to move through, unrestricted, with the Catholic social doctrine. Nothing will be left out, and everything will be just as hoped. More advantageous than even the trend of support set by this move is the influence it grants us within the Alianza Popular. The effective puppets that make up the loyalists are stronger and supposedly have more weight behind what they say."

 IBR.670.d:0 "A corporatist system in Iberia is not to be. Pitted against the best speakers the party could bring to bear, the Alianza Popular just couldn't be aligned towards a more controlled economy. With reactions ranging from distaste to disgust to even hostility, there are only a few who didn't reject our ideas.\n\nInitially the talks proceeded well. Once the far-reaching nature of our policies became obvious, the tone of negotiations changed drastically. From one of those present, 'the whole place dropped a few degrees. Nearly anyone who got what we meant gave us some kind of look.'\n\nWithout these discussions any chances of securing Alianza Popular support for the policy are gone. Nobody else would be willing to even humor these arguments, so a corporatist dream is futile. Even worse, the AP seem less inclined to work with us on economic matters over this quarrel, which means that even a neutered version of the measure is dead in the water."

 IBR.671.d:0 "After a long and heated debate on a new economic system with the Alianza Popular - not least of which was talking them down from an abrupt and unceremonious 'no' - the party has finally given their grudging approval. Our theoretical economic system will be supported by them in the legislature. With one caveat. We need to propose a system, in its entirety, within a day. If we do not, then the deal is off.\n\nThe prospect of planning an entire system in the space of twenty-four hours proved too much for our economists. Their relief was palpable when it was revealed that much of it was already planned. The ideals were there, and only the minutiae between them needed to be plotted out. The Alianza Popular seemed taken aback when a completed economic plan were presented to them, but they honored their deal and the new corporatist reforms await implementation."

 IBR.672.d:0 "Following the beginning of the implementation of the corporatist economic system, many figures people took it poorly. Not only was the plan vehemently opposed by everyone outside of both the Alianza Popular and our own party, but the attitude that the corporatism is fascist seems to have spilled out into the common people. Rapidly rallying their supporters in Madrid, the opposition have used their useful idiots for two purposes. Firstly, they have harassed Unión Nacional members. Even worse is their second use, in which they have been used as leverage to reverse the measures before they go into full swing.\n\nFrom their advantageous position the protestors are capable of placing an immense pressure on the government, which could easily be assuaged by calling the policies off. The side effect of this would be that this would embolden the opposition, which could threaten to deadlock the already fragile system. It wouldn't be popular, but in order to properly disperse the rabble it would be more effective to call in the Guardia Civil to force them to depart."

 IBR.673.d:0 "Without even being fully implemented, the corporatist project has led to unexpected consequences. As the market has run itself for so long without the policies in place, it required time to correct itself. Sadly, correction is a long and painful process. This pain came in the form of a downturn economically. Because of the obsession with constant growth this came at great detriment to our popularity, both internally and externally. We have fallen under attack from short-sighted figures from every end of the political spectrum, and the whole affair has been very unpleasant.\n\nEverything we could do to save our situation was to rapidly roll back the corporatist system. This has not saved much, but it left a salvageable sum we would lack from doubling down. It has inspired a wave of militants and reprobates to begin vocal opposition to our party. Circling the wagons should be able to silence most of them, but it seems the damage has been done."

The public's faith in us has been decimated, but that can be remedied by various maneuvers. What's more damaging is our own government's loss of faith in our ability. Despite the Alianza Popular's willingness to go along or at least compromise on most matters, they no longer wish to associate themselves with us on economic matters. It will not be an issue in the short term, but once the economy requires further calibration we will find ourselves in unfortunate circumstances.\n\nEven though the Alianza Popular's disappointment was wounding, worst of all was the rifts created within the Unión Nacional. As a large segment were willing to support our measures knowing they would work out, so when they backfired many of the turncoats defected to the Alianza Popular, further cleaving our support in the Congress."

The most likely outcome was leftist rabble-rousing, using their influence to damage the new history's credibility. It worked, as some of the most common reactions involve calling it 'extremely contrived' and equating it to historical revisionism. This taste is one that will likely stay in the public's mouth, even though we can force the new curriculum through.

The contents of the theft were discovered by their publication, and not their missing nature from the party headquarters. Valcárcel's drafts, and the plans based on them, were what had been stolen. In their place were a number of 'decoy' documents, which only held up to a quick glance's inspection.\n\nA scandal this size has never been seen before, and getting away from it before consequences come crashing down is probably impossible. Attempts to deflect or divert the public anger have failed. Rather than be mad at the criminals who leaked it, they have instead opted to be angry at the people being leaked. Since de Valcárcel is the head of the party, it falls on him to take decisive action to make sure backlash is minimized. With all of this occurring, the man takes his stance:"

Worse than that! They suppress this news, and then they expect us to pretend it never happened! Even though they were bad before, it wasn't ever this bold! I will stand. I will stand for Iberia! I will stand for democracy! Who stands with me!?\" The apparent revolutionary stopped to catch his breath, the noise washed away by the caterwauling of his followers.\n\nThis sort of incident happened many ways, in many places. And, because of their natures as spectacles, they gained mass attention. With the media growing unruly, the message only got out to more people. In these reached people it found more supporters, and so on. The whole thing had nearly irreversibly spiraled out of control by the time it made its way to Valcárcel's attention. The revolutionary leaders needed to be arrested, and their message suppressed before it reached even more citizens. Even if the move could add more flames to the fire."

Furious with the very fact that the plans existed to be leaked, Fraga spent a large amount of time nearly screaming, making his chagrin at having been tricked into supporting a 'group so authoritarian as theirs'. Francoism was a mistake, and they deceived the Alianza Popular into supporting it. Because of this, the two parties would never associate again. Instead of just staying alone, they would instead work with a separate organization to bring the Unión Nacional their day of reckoning.\n\nWhile most of this was to be expected given the circumstances, the final statement worried Valcárcel. In the past few days the party had made a lot of enemies, and this was no bluff he wanted to call. As the next meeting of the Congress approached, he felt a growing dread."

But there was something wrong..\n\nThe opposing political parties seemed too self-assured, too smug.. Something was amiss. A conspiracy had clearly hatched. These suspicions proved themselves right when that same opposition made their move. Beginning by divulging that every exit was blocked, the so-proclaimed 'Democratic Salvation Coalition' and their spokesman - Fraga himself - began speaking to their captive audience.\n\nTheir message, while delivered in so, so many more words, was simple: The Unión Nacional's authoritarian tendencies were unacceptable, francoist, and would drag the entire Union into the dark days they never should be taken back to. Therefore, for the good of the nation, the Unión Nacional could not remain in power any longer. The whole party would stay in the building until they jointly announced their resignations.

First things first.\n\nThe man looked around, until he found what he wanted to see: an entrance, left unattended. The door stood wide open. All it would take is the attention to be focused somewhere else. So de Valcárcel tapped the shoulder of another party member - a dedicated, trustworthy hardliner - and gave him some simple instructions. Cause a fuss, make a scene, just draw all the attention to you.\n\nAs the man made a fool of himself to a watching audience, de Valcárcel crept out of the room and through the hallways. Keeping hidden as to make sure nobody saw him sneaking around, he looked through room and room, searching for a very particular object. He would call the Guardia Civil, and have them arrest the opposition! The only issue was to find a phone that also wasn't monitored.

Once he was fully confident he couldn't - a process of elimination that was increasingly painful the longer it went on - he simply couldn't find it in him to keep going. His gaze locked to the floor, shoulders slumped, he walked forward and grabbed a resignation form, and sloppily signed his signature.\n\nWith his position forfeit and his presence no longer justified, de Valcárcel shuffled his way out of the Chamber.

However, a large number of obstacles remain in our way to save the Union.\n\nTheir first failsafe is in the bureaucracy. The Unión Nacional has sunk their talons deep, and a large amount of administrators still have loyalty - or sympathies - for the Francoists. These unknown loyalties could prove detrimental, and if they aren't eliminated it could stop any meaningful reform.\n\nIt is undeniable that the UN managed to take a near-frightening grasp on the population, especially in the conservative sectors. This same grip allowed them to do a large amount of damage to Iberian society, with harmful religious propaganda, inflamed minority tensions, and nearly assert their control for a \"New State\".\n\nEven though their influence and reach were nearly all-encompassing, their more authoritarian policies provide a good framework to tear down the last resurgence of Franco's loyalists.

 IBR.685.d:0 "On and on continued de Valcárcel, ranting and raving about anything that crossed his mind, made him mad, and could vaguely be tied to the Alianza Popular. He was fully engrossed in his speech. As such, he failed to notice the Guardia Civil moving near the Unión Nacional members, slowly surrounding them. It was only when a party leader pushed back against an officer and was wrestled to the floor. The noise of the fight was enough to knock de Valcárcel out of his trance, and as he turned to look he was handcuffed.\n\nMeagre protest was all the man could raise, and the knowledge that everything he did was going to be undone collapsed on him. Most didn't see much, but a younger man saw the leader of the Unión Nacional in tears as he walked by - a sight more pitiful than anything. The rest of the Unión Nacional was escorted out shortly behind him. Awkwardly shuffling towards the near exit, most left with either silence or quiet muttering."

 IBR.5412.d:0 "Unfortunately, we can't rule alone. If we could, the country would be back under a rightful eye and a strong director. Our coalition partner, the Alianza Popular, is still an independent party, and so we need to keep them happy, for the most part. Usually, the most it takes is a concession on some policy or another. With the recent crisis unfolding, we can compromise on plenty of things to get them to keep their heads down.\n\nThe recent drop in oil has made it necessary for non-essential workers to stay home, for conservation. They simply burn too much oil in transit, as well as with running the actual places of work. We can't stop many private workers, but several state professions have been called to stay home to preserve fuel. The Alianza, ever the fiscal hawks, have lobbied for the salaries of these public workers to be frozen, or reduced in proportion to the hours they currently work. We have to do something at the minimum, but if we go as far as the Alianza Popular desires then we may lose support from the people whose salaries have suddenly disappeared. Of course, this may give us a perfect opportunity to extend our influence over them..."

 IBR.5413.t:0 "Collecting Additional Revenue"
 IBR.5413.d:0 "Oil use needs to be curbed. It has to be curbed, in fact, if Iberia wants to keep functioning. We need to make sure our use of the black gold is less than the scant amounts we can acquire, until the shortage is concluded.\n\nThe current proposal is a raised consumption tax, effectively discouraging oil use by taxing people extra for using it. This plan has attracted remarkable support, both from our coalition and from the other parties. Using this once-in-a-lifetime cross-party support, the law itself is a certainty. The only question is how to best apply the tax.\n\nBack when Franco was in charge, the government didn't need to concern itself with popular support. They simply did what was best, without boiling it down to sate the masses. Franco is no longer here, and his government gone, and to ever bring it back we will need the support of the people. The law would undoubtedly work better if we applied it universally, but if we were to spare the common worker from it, then we would definitely gain their support. Either will work, it is just a question of which is best."

 IBR.5414.t:0 "A Counteroffer"
 IBR.5414.d:0 "The debtor organizations which sought to undermine our government were very malleable, once we acted against them. They thought themselves very clever, with their extortion and their ability to hide horrible deals just under the surface. The creditors have greatly reduced their demands after we threatened to destroy them with full force. It isn't a bad thing by any means, but there is the possibility of gaining more.\n\nThe government is definitely not the only group these bastards have scammed, and if we do nothing we will be far from the last. We could definitely make use of these services more than once - though what would bring us there is unknowable - if we kept them going. If we were to try them for their usury and make a great show of it, then it would undoubtedly be a great victory in the eyes of the common man."

Of course, they were not watching him yet- he still had some brief time before he was live. He was worried, for a moment, but the politician crushed his doubt like a separatist. He was Franco's successor, damnit, and he would need to speak like it too. Allowing doubt to fester would be a betrayal of Iberia.\n\nOnce he was live, he began to speak. Emphasizing with grand, sweeping movements of his hands, Valcárcel spoke of the need for unity, above all else.\n\nOr at least, he would have if he had not knocked down his water bottle. He had totally stopped, staring at the water bottle- for far too long - before picking it up in spite of the puddle it had made, and then recomposed himself.\n\n\"This must not destroy our Union, Iberians! We are one country, united by our common heritage, and we must act like it! This is your struggle, and it is the struggle of the National Union, and it is the struggle of Iberia! We...\" He trailed off, having forgotten the rest of his sentence. \"...We will struggle together! Iberia will be united in prosperity, but first it must struggle united through hardship!\"\n\nOnce all was said and done, Valcárcel found that it could have gone far worse.

If the newly appointed head of the Guardia Civil was nervous, few could tell. Back straight, his face a visage of determined calm, he was a military man through and through. All knew his record: A former Falangist and veteran of the notorious División Azul which fought for Nazi Germany, he had now chosen to side with Iberian democracy and the Democratic Salvation Coalition.\n\n\"Good morning,\" he began, greeting the assembled journalists. \"I am here today in my capacity as Director General of the Guardia Civil to announce that by direction from the Minister of the Interior, the Guardia Civil, alongside the National Police Corps, the Municipal Police, and other regional law enforcement agencies, have begun a nation-wide inter-agency investigation into the involvement of federal agencies, government organizations, and state officials in the election of the Unión Nacional. It is the belief of the Guardia Civil, and the newly convened Democratic Salvation Coalition, that forces within the Iberian state manipulated the election result, ensuring a win for Unión Nacional in full knowledge of their plans to subvert the Constitution.\"\n\nBefore he could even finish two dozen hands shot up while the room exploded into a cacophony of questions. Topete simply held his hand up, calling for silence.\n\n\"Now, before I answer any questions, I wish to address those who may be listening who assisted in this plot. I say to you: Turn yourselves in. The Unión Nacional has been defeated. There is no further cause for undermining the Iberian Constitution with the aim of restoring the Unión Nacional to its position of power. You will be found, caught, and punished.\""

 IBR.751.t:0 "The Results Of The Investigation"
 IBR.751.d:0 "Director General José Luis Aramburu Topete looked over the list one last time. There were many names he knew here, men who he had fought with during the civil war, even some he had fought alongside in Russia with the División Azul. Such men would surely call him a turncoat, a traitor to the Falange, Caudillo Franco, and the Iberian nation. Aramburu didn't much care what they thought anymore. In his many years in the military he had always made choices based on what he felt was most in line with law, order, and security. During his youth that had meant siding with Franco against the terroristic insanity of communism. Now it meant siding with Iberian democracy against his former comrades and their fanatical authoritarianism.\n\nThe list was long, some 300 pages, containing the names of thousands of government employees, army officers, civil bureaucrats, and electoral officials, all party to the conspiracy to rig the elections in favor of the Unión Nacional. Hundreds of confessions had been correlated and compiled, leading to an ever growing number of exposed traitors. Most if not all would be charged with serious crimes, but that would have to wait. Now it was time to purge them all from their positions, and ensure they couldn't do any more damage.\n\nPlacing the list in his briefcase and getting up to head to the Ministry of the Interior, where he would present the Guardia Civil's findings to the new government, Aramburu could not shake the feeling that this was only the beginning. The list was larger than even he had expected, and if the Unión Nacional had this much support inside the state, there was no telling how much they still had outside of it."

But now all we can guarantee is that the names that were listed will soon be serving prison terms for violating our new electoral system.\n\nIt is a shame that it has come to this, but we can at least show to the world that we will take our new democracy seriously."

But when the Guardia Civil went to seize the Unión Nacional records, all they were confronted with was many empty filing cabinets and piles of ashes in the party headquarters. All of the party's records from the last election have simply gone up in smoke.\n\nClearly, this was to hide their illegal activities of voter fraud, and to prevent the police and government from taking legal action. They have managed to hide their network of agents and saboteurs seeking to destroy our nascent democracy through fire and smoke. While we don't have any hard evidence, an officer of the Guardia Civil, speaking anonymously to the press, revealed our discovery. This has led to denunciations in the newspapers, and in turn the anger of the Iberian people. The UN is scrambling to respond to this incriminating act."

Teams have been working around the clock to sort through the files and determine if something, anything illegal or incriminating has been discovered. So far, the answer is... very little. Maybe some of the entries in ledgers could be seen as possible evidence of voter fraud, but there is nothing solid or definite, and no 'smoking gun' that can unravel the whole mystery. What we have will help us, but it's not enough.\n\nThis is disconcerting, to say the least. Either the UN has managed to keep a massive voter fraud scheme virtually under wraps, or, much more concerning to our government, the UN has much more support than we realize.

Sitting in a bulletproof car across from the building, he radioed the order to begin the operation.\n\nThe building was stormed quickly, with no casualties. It seems that any of the Falangists who remained had chosen to surrender rather than make a last stand. Hearing that the coast was clear, Aramburu exited the vehicle, and headed through the front doors to the building. Entering the lobby, he found his men detaining several Falangists in military uniform, on their knees with their hands cuffed behind their backs.\n\n\"Aramburu, you traitor,\" one of them spat, looking up at him. The Director General did not recognize him. Perhaps one of his former subordinates in the Civil Guard. \"What is the meaning of this? This is private property. You have no right to be here.\"\n\n\"I am here on orders of the Minister of the Interior and the Court of Auditors,\" he replied, ignoring the disdain of the prisoners. \"You are to hand over all documents pertaining to the last election so that they may be submitted as part of the government's review of the election results. Where do you keep your files?\"\n\n\"Burn in hell,\" the Falangist scoffed, a look of disgust across his face. \"You will get nothing out of us.\"\n\nAramburu sighed.

Even the Caudillos have gone silent, perhaps realizing that they were backing the wrong horse. Or, more likely, that it would look really bad for them to stand in the way of democracy and the law.\n\nSome diehard supporters of the UN maintain a lonely vigil outside the courthouse, but they are outnumbered by the police and counter-protestors that support our effort to maintain the rule of law.

In line with that, the portraits of the Caudillos will no longer be placed in every classroom, schools can now no longer raise the national flag at the beginning of the week and take it down at the end, college students are no longer required to sign an oath of allegiance to the state, the daily prayer and allegiance to the state have been removed.\n\nBut the biggest concern will be that of the subjects that are taught. While mathematics and science will be less affected, there are some that will need to be overhauled: for example, we will encourage more diversity in the reading materials in both Spanish and Portuguese classes. History, however, is the biggest issue. The new law sets up a non-partisan board of historians and academics to rewrite the history textbooks, to provide a more equal and balanced subject for our students to learn at all levels of education. While we can still take pride in Iberia through the study of history, we must also recognize that we had done bad or terrible things in our past, and must acknowledge them."

While most of the law deals with the minor details to ensure that elections are fair, some of the most important aspects of the law is simple to understand: an impartial, non-partisan group will be in charge to provide the ballots, the ballot boxes, and set up polling places, as well as educating the public in how the elections work. The parties themselves will be banned from the polling places: no party posters, campaigners or materials will be allowed within 50 meters of any polling station.

The head of the Guardia Civil gave explicit orders: no violence of any kind, by any party or group, is to be tolerated. If an agitator is trying to rile up the crowd, they are to be arrested. If a mob starts to form, they are to be broken up. If anyone tries to hamper anyone from voting, they will be charged with voter fraud and taken into custody.

 IBR.708.d:0 "The Iberian Union has in recent times gotten closer to the OFN, trying to build strong diplomatic ties across the vast Atlantic, which our strategists have lauded as a vital step towards our final victory in the cold War against the withering fortress Europe. In the most recent summit hosted in Iberia itself, more specifically the region of Cataluña, a fascinating subject was raised that our delegation had not considered before the meeting, as we had expected just discussions on military and diplomatic matters.\n\nLa Canadiense, one of our state run electricity providers that came into our hands during the great European economic slump of the 50s when Belgian and Canadian private investors panickingly sold their stocks and assets to us seemed to be considerable interest to the Iberians. Seemingly the Iberians planned to surprise us with their proposals to buy the assets, based in the region we were currently in, right at the end of rigorous discussions on other more pressing diplomatic matters as to take advantage of our desires to leave the sweltering conference room quickly. A decision has to be made now, with our good diplomatic ties we can trust the Iberians to make good use of the company's assets and could mean even closer relations, however we could also try to capitalize on the old assets and make more profit for our government."

We now have the means to further invest in the area and expand existing structures and machinery to make best use of the opportunity of harvesting more energy for our bustling and electricity hungry population.

It was the notification that another Iberian delegation had arrived and been welcomed to do diplomacy with their eager US and OFN counterparts, however this time around they had brought very different instructions from Madrid and Lisbon, that caused a rather large stir in the conference. The piece of paper more importantly however stated in simple terms that the Iberians were ready to begin negotiations on officially entering the OFN as a key strategic ally in Europe. The decision that now has to be made, and it wasn't just his to make but other OFN members would follow suit, could be described as a key turning point in history.

 IBR.711.d:0 "The expected OFN mission to Iberia which was going to submit the much anticipated answer for our request to join the alliance of free nations was cancelled today, two days before it would have arrived in an eager Madrid. Disappointed civil servants were in the process of abandoning the plans that had been made well in advance for the diplomats' arrival when an important notice was passed onto all ministries within the Iberian governmental structure. The Americans had sent an official letter, cordial in tone, declaring that due to vital strategic considerations when analyzing the European situation, Iberia was currently not able to be accepted in the OFN, a blow that struck hard considering the steadily improving relations between our nation and the democracies of the world. A major caveat was included in the letter however, Iberia would be allowed to join in a limited capacity as an OFN Observer. [ROOT.GetLeader] viewed the offer of the letter with more gratitude than many of his pessimistic ministers. The option to become an observer nation to the alliance would deepen ties across the Atlantic over time and perhaps lead to another chance for the Iberians. For now, he could only sigh deeply and put away the speech he was going to hold for the honored guests that would never arrive at a specially organized banquet that would never occur."

The currently still hidden motive these visits and the increase of cordial correspondence between the former despotic but German opposed federal union and us was clearly visible; the two combined peoples were likely wanting to draw closer to our alliance itself and from there join it as an equal member. A possibly very lucrative enterprise considering the strength of a Europe still shrouded in darkness and a protective Far East. It however would not come without danger as the Germans have proven themselves in recent decades to not be very sensible folk, especially when reacting to foreign made stimuli. Our decision therefore is how to continue dealing with the Iberians, should we draw nearer quicker or only better relations slowly, betting on the Iberians not abandoning their current foreign policy towards us."

Their arrival should be marked as a historical event. He had been unsure whether the Americans and their allies would pursue the great risk directly associated with visiting Iberia after he had sent a successful diplomatic mission recently to Washington. The positive news had opened entirely new pathways for his two peoples to find their position on the world stage amongst the competing world powers, finally there might be the option of directly being involved in the future of a ravaged Europe and the struggling globe in general. Not just being eternal watchers or low level influencers as a secondary power in a doomed anti-German alliance. Hope was the primary emotion of many Spanish and Portuguese as the impressive American plane landed in Madrid, and this was reflected for the duration of their stay and during the lengthy discussions held at Madrid Palace Hotel in our bustling capital."

 IBR.714.t:0 "The Americans Send a Letter"
 IBR.714.d:0 "A very disappointing but understandable event occurred today that set back the foreign policy of the Iberian Union by considerable strides. Our gradual alignment with the OFN, having seen us sending special envoys to the US capital to foster cordial relations, with the possibility of closer diplomatic cooperation, seemingly has hit a minor wall in its path of progress. Instead of sending a diplomatic delegation of their own to visit our splendid homeland and continuing to foster better relations, the Americans have merely sent us a letter of appreciation. It contains a \"warm\" thanks for our efforts, but seems to contain little else for our analysts to go on. Seemingly the OFN still views having closer relations with our nation as a security hazard considering our close proximity to the slowly strengthening Fortress Europe. This was indeed factored into our predictions but still comes as an unwelcome turn of events. We however will not change our course of action, but instead tweak it to suit the careful Americans."

They will fit in any role we place them in, but there is still uncertainty to the degree they will be integrated with the military. We could place them in the general staff, which given their loyalty to us could be helpful, as well as the larger benefit they could provide to our military. If we were to keep them as separate advisors, it would be less controversial.\n\nThe population of Iberia is rather divided on this move, so we will need to make a decision with the opinions of the public in mind."

They are hardly xenophobic, but by-and-large are wary of outside influences, which they see as subversive.\n\nBy keeping the advisors on the sidelines and truly only advising, as we have, we have reached a situation that only benefits us.

With access to this valuable material cut off, its general pricing has fluctuated significantly, causing widespread economic downturn among many countries in the process.\n\nUnfortunately, the [Root.GetName] was not spared from this, as a majority of its oil was imported from abroad. At the same time, as the situation escalates, nations with large stockpiles either refuse to sell any of their precious petroleum, or spike its price to extremely high values. Another disadvantage brought about by this oil shortage is the departure of several foreign businesses operating in Iberia alongside the mass frenzy of investors, panicking and selling their stocks before it's too late. This has led the [Root.GetName] to experience nationwide cycles of worker lay-offs, mass unemployment, and incurment of large amounts of debt.

Not everyone has a house, and some lack the means to gain one. Even worse, some do - but they live in squalor and filth. It is true that we provide housing already, but our programs are not sufficient. I would propose intervention into the housing market, with the specifics to be worked out later.

 IBR.4012.d:0 "A growing movement in the congress has finally found itself sufficient support to debate colonial citizenship.\n\nIberian citizenship is granted automatically to anyone who has a parent with Iberian citizenship - at face value, it is a simple policy. However, it becomes significantly more complicated once one factors in other processes, such as colonial residence. The natives are considered non-Iberian, and denied citizenship. Effectively, they are denied any of the benefits one would gain from citizenship.\n\nA clique in the congress has argued against this policy, for several reasons. Some find it unjust to deny the natives citizenship, since they lived on the land before our settlers, and others oppose it for more practical reasons. They desire to create a \"collaborator\" group within the native populations with which to sabotage the others, or simply to ease administrative strain. The end result is the same: to give all African natives Iberian citizenship.\n\nTo say this argument experienced significant pushback is an understatement. Opposition has been fierce, with a great many wishing to maintain the status quo. The settler groups wish to keep the situation as it is, as the current laws work very favorably for the Iberian settlers. Ultimately, it is still the call of the Caudillos."

Despite their claims otherwise, it is glaringly obvious that they are upset by the fact that natives will no longer be treated as second-class citizens, and the new legal parity has upset those who took their supremacy for granted.

While the assembly did not come to blows, it came very close as law enforcement dispersed the protest.\n\nEven though this was a spontaneous action, it is representative of sentiments within native populations. We have been formally thanked by several native organizations - through the same channels as the settlers, in what seems to have been spite - for our decisions to extend citizenship."

 IBR.4015.d:0 "Tensions have reached an all-time high as Iberian mainlanders, furious with their lack of legal primacy, have resorted to less-than-legal methods of intimidating nearby colonials. Bands of retornados, armed with makeshift weapons, have started to hunt down and beat colonials they find vulnerable. This escalated when the natives started to fight back, creating what were quickly nicknamed \"brigas repentinas\", for their spontaneous and violent nature. As all incidents do, these fights began to escalate from two or three to as many as ten to fifteen on each side.\n\nIt has escalated again. After the murder of a retornado by a colonial native, riots have broken out in several major cities around the colonies between both.

Their conversation eventually leads them to the great question: what were they in for? All present had the same reason, the \"disruption of common decency\", but they all knew they were in for protesting the new citizenship laws. They were eventually split up, incarcerated for their deeds.\n\nSights like this had become very common, at least for a small while.

Regardless, it never paid to be unaware. He read the paper itself, expressing yet more legal provisions and regulations that, ultimately, just added up to common sense and basic decency. His silent musing was interrupted by the clicking of cameras, the flashes providing a harsh incentive to keep looking down. He supposed that nobody would be unsure of how the paperwork worked.\n\nThey found him again as he took the picture for his ID card, forcing him to keep the artificially widened smile on for even longer than he ever wanted. Better that than to frown for the cameras, he supposed.\n\nThe day came when the ID was ready to be received. Swamped by the press for what was undoubtedly an important day, he did his best pretend-to-want-to-be-here smile and held it up for everyone to see.\n\nSomeone asked him, \"How does it feel to be the first native to get citizenship?\" He knew what he had to say."

In fact, I'd even say it goes so far as to hinder decisive action, with even the tiniest thing to protect a country-\"\n\n\"Enough, you petty bastard!\" Franco snapped. \"It's enough that you groan and grumble over every little measure that doesn't coddle you like a damn child! I try to get one good thing done and all you can think about is taking jabs at me!\"\n\nThe two continued to bicker, at this point blind to the world beyond what they could use to argue with the other. The Council became one of the first external groups to see, in all its glory, the way in which the Caudillos cooperated. Everyone - except the two dictators - sat in silence, unable to muster the will to move or even stop watching the argument.\n\nThe clerk himself shrank back, unwilling to be near the source of the yelling.

A few slaps, a couple of punches, but the two were held back by their advanced age.\n\nYet again, the Council was in stunned silence. The army representative suddenly stood up, almost dragging the Axencia agent out of his seat.\n\n\"We need to stop them before they hurt themselves!\" The officer turned the agent to the door. \"Find a phone, call the Guardia Civil.\"\n\nAs the Axencia representative ran off, the military man turned to the rest of the Council. He needed to lead them, too, it seemed. Should he get some people to help him break up the Caudillos, or have a few explain to the Guardia?"

The two began fighting one another, presumably to figure out who would help their preferred Caudillo. It seems the spirit of pugilism was contagious, since most of the other council members had gotten into miniature brawls of their own.\n\nKnowing there was nothing he could do, the officer sighed and walked to the door. He figured that he could watch for the Guard and also keep an eye on the Caudillos. He hardly had to wait for the Guard, as several officers walked in a few moments after me made it near the door.\n\nThe situation was easily explained with a sweep of the hand - a good most of the council was fighting itself, and a handful were trying to pull people off of one another. It only took one person to stop the Caudillos from fighting, simply pushing the two old men apart, and the rest of the council took several minutes to stop. Most had the sense to stop once they saw the Guard arrive, however.\n\nThe Guardia Civil dispersed the meeting, and sent everyone away with mostly bruises and scrapes. If there was to be more discussion, it would be once the tensions had died down."

He didn't seem to be dead on closer inspection, merely unconscious, but those few moments allowed all hell to break loose.\n\nThe soldier beheld the true nature of the discussion, as the entire council dissolved into anarchy. Man fought man, and although nobody seemed to be using weapons, they sure did zealously swing their fists. Nothing he could do about any of them, his mind quickly thought, so he did the one thing he could.\n\nIt was very easy to break up the Caudillos, simply a matter of prying apart two old men. Then, he kept the two away from each other until the Guardia Civil arrived - a tense few minutes. The Guard did much more to break up the meeting than he could, seemingly absorbing the hostility of the rumble and using it against the council men.\n\nAfter an eternity of fighting, the final damages were tallied. A large number of members had been arrested for their brawling, and the Caudillos were sent to their homes to stew for a while, until the event was behind them. It was quite an unfortunate event, but perhaps it was better to have it settled now, rather than in an even more important event."

The system is decentralized, and the regional courts can run around as if they are independent!\" He quietly hoped that didn't seem too monotone. \"Iberia can only fulfil its promise of unity when all elements of the country are united as if they were never separate. Our courts are no different. Are there any questions?\"\n\nSomeone, to his dread, had a question. \"How would we best integrate these courts? Centralization should only be attempted if we can ensure it does not go poorly. Therefore, I want to hear your ideas on the matter.\"\n\nOh no.\n\nIn an act of divine providence, someone was able to interject and answer the question, moving the pressure away from him.

Because of its position, it is coincidentally a very important institution to keep loyal. The faith of many leads them to believe the Church, and if the Church is friendly to us, then so will the congregations follow. Some would argue that this is not a good thing.\n\nThere has been an argument that the influence of the Church - its monopolistic control over education, religion, and in many ways the thoughts of the faithful - is too great. The same groups arguing this propose that the Church's influence be checked, so that Iberia is not dependent on its loyalty.

Were he a sensible man, he wouldn't have abandoned his poached egg and toasted bread for the letter apparently rushed to him from Madrid, but unfortunately for him he was a politician and such sense was not allowed in this profession.\n\nBright eyes quickly scanned the letter, absorbing both the written word and the unwritten intent behind them all at once. He stood from the table as he reached the end, his mind already turning over the newfound information. According to the letter, the Shadow State was storming into the French rump state and to no one's surprise, the French were receiving the worst of the fighting. The French had been more or less a non-factor for over a decade, unable to maintain control of much of the country outside of Algiers itself. That's why they were here in Oran after all, and the Italians on the other side of the garrison.\n\nBut the letter was much more vague with its actual orders, a necessary tactic to maintain plausible deniability should it somehow fall outside of Iberian hands and cause a scandal. That didn't matter though, they wouldn't have sent him this letter without knowing what he'd do once he got to reading it, and already, he was deep in thought.\n\nA spin, Iberia needed a spin to justify the acquisition of Algeria. While, yes, militarily occupied by both themselves and Italians, it was still legally French, and they weren't in a position to simply take the rest of the country by storm. After all, if they did that, they'd be fighting Italians, not the scarecrow army of the French State. So what excuse could they conjure up that would prevent the Italians from intervening?\n\nHe sat there deep in thought for some time, running through the scenarios in his head. It was clear that whatever scheme was cooked up, they'd have to work with the Italians directly to achieve it.

But in these modern times, it seems like every rock, every blade of grass and every grain of sand is owned by somebody, somewhere, and no one was interested in selling. The world was as small as it was ever going to be, and no one saw value in losing their corner of it.\n\nThat's why when the Caudillos called the greatest military and diplomatic minds of Iberia together to discuss plans for the French Colony of Algeria, they came not with vague ideas and concepts, but with papers, with maps, with briefcases and books worth of schemes. This was an opportunity that they all knew they'd never again see in their lifetimes, a chance to be known as the conqueror- through guns or through words- of Algeria.\n\nGenerals came with grand campaigns and elaborate war plans, some even going as far as to invade Tunis and Libya should the Italians stand in their way. Diplomats cracked open briefcases to reveal grand schemes and plans to buy or swindle the Italian half of Algeria out from beneath their feet. When the Caudillos made the call for all spheres of Iberia to form a plan together, they instead got a rapid- and long- succession of political sales pitches."

After discarding the obvious losers, and then the less obvious losers, the Caudillos were left with two plans to decide between.\n\nAmong the generals, Kaúlza de Arriaga's scheme had the most support. A limited war, but with the added benefit of looking towards the white French colonials in Algeria for support, and the creation of a cooperative government with them in the process. The Kaúlza Plan, as it has been called since he first presented it to the Caudillos, calls for open warfare in Algeria to simultaneously drive out the Italians and pacify the natives all in one fell swoop. The generals have rallied behind the Kaúlza Plan, and already believe that Salazar will support them.\n\nMeanwhile, among the diplomats, Adriano Moreira's plan had proven to be the most attractive. Rather than approaching the Italian government directly- which would require a great deal of expense to acquire the Italian half of the region- he proposes that Iberia should instead approach the Italian oil giant, ENI. If they can convince ENI to support the Iberian claim to Algeria in exchange for a generous deal on oil development in the region, ENI could in turn put much more intense pressure on Italy to accept the Iberian claim. The other diplomats and politicians have abandoned their own rejected plans to support the Moreira Plan, and hope that Franco will support them in turn."

Normally they wouldn't time a meeting so oddly, but Franco had requested he enter once he had fully collected his thoughts on the Algerian issue, and not one moment earlier or later. Sadly, what this meant was that Franco had to dedicate nearly the entire day to waiting, for whenever his counterpart finally got around to attending. He was thankful, then, that they showed up shortly after lunch.\n\nAs expected, Salazar got to talking as soon as he closed the door behind him.\n\n\"I had to see everything, but I've made up my mind- Algeria needs to be secured. At any cost, it doesn't matter, we need to guarantee the retornados a home.\" Franco began to open his mouth to respond, but Salazar snapped at him first. \"Don't start about pragmatism to me, not about this. Those retornados were exiled from their home once already, I would rather die than let them be kicked out again, and so soon after the first time! Arriaga's plan will guarantee them their home, and he'll make sure those Italian bastards recognize it!\"\n\nFranco half-sighed, half-grunted in annoyance. \"I can't fault you for being passionate about your people, but you are refusing to see the larger picture. We need peace in Algeria. A war will win them the land, maybe, but then where will you be, when they all die fighting for it? What good would it do, Salazar?\" Salazar started a response, getting out perhaps half a word before Franco interrupted him. \"Whatever we settle on, just remember. It needs to be unanimous...\""

He spared a glance to his colleague - who was more focused on the plans before them - before returning his gaze to Kaúlza and Moreira, who seemed more concerned with shuffling through their things. Eventually, they both prepared to present, but Kaúlza was mandated to go first.\n\nHe spoke loud, with a boisterous tone that showed his total confidence in his plans. He didn't have any formal charts or flashy models, but simply passed out two pieces of paper and laid a map out on the conference table, a map of Algeria. He detailed the situation (as he saw it), then carefully explained how they could swipe the rest of the country from the Italians. To this end, he also explained the contents of the documents he passed out - they were manifests, of the equipment they'd require, optimistically, to get the job done.\n\nOnce Kaúlza finished, it was time for Moreira to present his plan for Algeria. During the war plan briefing, the politician had taken the time to properly set up a presentation, though his delivery left some to be desired. He explained his plan, how working with ENI could win Algeria, and of how to make deals situated to look desirable to them. He pointed out the resources required, and how to best use them. With a style of utilizing as little words as possible, his side of the meeting concluded remarkably quickly.\n\nAs both sides had finished their presentation, the Caudillos spoke their verdict. While they both made designs to sell their plans, what the two didn't know was that the Caudillos had both already decided. They told the two, in their back-and-forth speech style, that..."

By planting the seed of profit, we have shown the Italians that our objectives are friendship and cooperation.\n\nTo cement this, diplomats have been sent into a meeting with Italian officials.

Many of the state run industries which had been under the jurisdiction of multiple government ministries, like the defense or interior, were beginning to be packaged and repurposed to be sold to Iberian private investors who had slightly different goals than their state counterparts. As conservative and falangist protests are springing up around the nation, none large enough to be of immediate concern, the market was beginning its impersonal processes, valuing the prices for the various new products that had just been added to the selection of supply.

At first it seemed as if the state would be running a loss selling capital at a price below the rate expected. This did not bother us, as the main goal was to stimulate the economy and not exploit these sales. Yet as time went by, it seems that private investors were not quite as accustomed to the new Iberian economy as Ullatres had hoped. It was not long before many were asking for subsidies to provide lucrative contracts to the state instead of working on the market. Even worse, it seems that others read some loopholes in the sale agreements and were selling them to foreign investors.

How can such a powerful tool be given to a citizenry who still in parts respects the empty promises of demagogues whether on the right or left? This has to be a slow process, one guided by our party as we have Iberia's future at the core of our mission, not personal advantage.

We can however not just limit ourselves in the social sphere to this as our nation is not just plagued by a hovering identity crisis.

Instead many major roads in Barcelona are blocked by throngs of people protesting for something they have no right to, divorce for any reason. This cannot stand; sedition like this spreading among the populace would shift Iberian politics out of control.

 IBR.5024.d:0 "Citizens of Iberia were greeted today with unsettling news. A government probe has discovered that local institutions around the nation were infested with crooked civil servants who were funded by businesses and private interest groups from the previous era. Their goals were still unclear but their treachery was obvious. Only by chance and skill of the investigators had this scandal been uncovered as judges and other lawmen had covered for the traitors. Even more menacingly it seems that this corruption and nepotism was not just restricted to the various regions of the peninsula but rather had even made its way up to the national level.\n\nNationwide people began to match on the streets protesting against this outrage, calling for the government to intervene. And intervene it shall, but what should be focused on first? The political establishment that had secured and furthered the crookedness of the numerous businessmen who helped fund them along the way?"

The choice to be made is not a simple one with both sides bringing hefty negatives that will weigh heavily on the shoulders of the administration. This should not be a surprise however as no disaster of this scale is likely to reap many positives. Not even when the old seats can be filled with those loyal to the new Iberia. The more benevolent option is to continue monitoring the traitors and try to reform them, only seeking to eliminate those beyond saving and who have done the most damage. The effectiveness of this is unclear sadly, hence may harm long term goals of the government. Mass arrests on the other hand will make sure that the system can be rebuilt, fashioned into a more effective state devoid of the taint of the of the past. Yet this will not go without consequences when caving to the public. A hard choice will need to be made."

Even small conservative rural towns were not spared of this treatment either, rather they seemed to garner the most state attention.\n\nShortly after noon it became clear why, in many of the locations that were covered large mobs began to assemble, waving placards and posters decrying the government crackdown on conservative and falangists, painting them to be one of political sabotage. Having had time to set up and gain advantageous positions the police was able to control the protests and keep most of the planned marches peaceful.

The head of Opus Dei, Josemaría Escrivá, who had been making his way home after the meeting with president earlier in the day had been shot by a lone assailant while climbing into his car. He had been quickly rushed to the hospital, but his condition at this point in time was unclear. It was likely that the would be assassin was a Falangist unhappy with the current political situation. The gears were already beginning to turn even before the staffer could finish, Ullastres considered the possible assassin list and motives, considered reprimands, considered consequences.

Even prior to the crisis this policy had been deeply criticised by members of our government who argued that all it was doing was wasting precious resources which would have been allocated more efficiently by the market. The crisis has given these arguments further impetus, throwing even previous defenders behind the idea that reform was needed.

We likely should hence pay them back now.\n\nYet we are completely in our right to withhold on these payments.

Directly addressing those who were currently employed he promised that with the eventual upcoming upswing in the economy there surely will be a place for them to return to. He however did not apologise. Staying resolute he argued that the policies of the government had been a necessary countermeasure to prevent the crisis from deepening further and critically affecting the economy. With the reforms the newly restructured economy, which now would be able to gain even more from free market efficiency, would emerge from the crisis stronger and more durable to future shocks.

For centuries regionalism was allowed to fester until it became a sagging boil that exploded into two devastating civil wars. Now, with democracy restored and the sensible administrators of the Alianza Popular in power, Iberia had a once in a millenia opportunity to put aside regionalism once and for all. Jorge Verstrynge knew this. His enemies in Congress did not.\n\nFor almost an hour now they had been causing a scene, the parliamentarians of the Unión Republicana and the Partido Renovador Democrático, berating the government in the strongest possible terms over its opposition to the autonomy of the regions. Verstrynge had listened to their outbursts quietly, allowing others from his party to respond to their cajoling, but he was growing tired of the antics. Taking the next opportunity to speak, he rose to the podium.\n\n\"Fellow Deputies, I have listened intently to the intervention of those opposite. And I must say, I am thoroughly disappointed. It is as if those opposite have forgotten all the events of the past 40 years. How separatism fueled the divisions of Spain and tore it apart in civil war. How Iberia mere years ago was plunged into the fires of seperatist insanity, leaving hundreds of thousands dead. Well, we here in the government have not forgotten the dead! We have not forgotten the debt of blood that Iberia owes to the martyrs who died for its liberty and unity against separatists and extremists alike! No, we will not allow you to once again fan the flames of separatism that have torn this nation apart. We in the government will chart a new course, one towards a strong, united Iberia!\"\n\nThe opposition howled in indignation at Verstrynge's fiery retort, and the debate raged on and on."

The victory of the Alianza Popular had made sure of that, and President Manuel Fraga Iribarne wanted to make sure everyone else remembered it. Regionalist hysteria and terroristic separatism would not be tolerated in the new, democratic Iberia. He knew that the sooner that everyone, including the troublesome separatists themselves, understood and accepted this, the better off everyone would be.\n\nThe new law just passed by Congress made that very very clear. Defining the rights and duties of Iberia's regions, the legislation practically ended all pretense of political autonomy, leaving them more as symbolic institutions than actual levers of government. A large portion of people would undoubtedly be very angry. The opposition were practically livid. They would all get over it eventually.\n\nYet there was little point rubbing salt in an open wound. The separatists would be offered a few small symbolic concessions, things that might be of some importance to them, but of little real significance to the unity and security of Iberia. What did he care if the Catalans and Basque wanted to speak their own languages in private? Or perform their own little national dances? Such things harmed no-one.\n\nHe would of course anger the hardliners in his party and those further to the right, but that was inevitable when charting a course away from the ruinous, divisive politics of the past regime. Fraga knew that he was in a unique position to finally solve the issue of the regions once and for all, and forge a democratic and truly united Iberia.

A nobleman on horseback, dressed in rural finery, chuckles and canters forth, giving the ox a whack with his riding crop and finally setting the mound of muscle in motion. The ox gives a guttural bray, lifting its head from grazing and continuing on its arduous journey across the field. The peasant smiles and raises a fist in triumph, drawing cheers from the large crowd of onlookers seated nearby. A camera clicks, capturing a memory of the past come back to life.\n\nOf course, this is no 16th-century farm, but the first annual 'Rural Roots Festival', designed to honour Iberia's rural past. Held on a warm day near Madrid, the festival has drawn tens of thousands so far with many more expected to arrive from as far afield as Catalonia and Portugal. The peasant and nobleman are just two of many historical re-enactors who have been tirelessly entertaining and educating the crowds. Beside the entrance to the main performance field stretch triple rows of stalls, numbering in the hundreds; many a well-off farmer has travelled up from Andalusia and Extremadura to hawk prime produce, jam, wine and honey. The citizens of Madrid, so used to the greys and browns of urban life, are spoiled for choice and clearly dazzled by the charm and diversity of the countryside's gifts.\n\nAs the day draws to a close and the sun dips towards the horizon, sleepy children are herded home, many tightly clutching toys and curios hard-won in traditional games. More than one farmer, who mere years ago was struggling to make ends meet, fires up his truck and sets off for home with a load of empty crates and a bulging wallet. As earnings and attendance figures roll in, a local council member smiles - this year's budget will be nicely padded for once."

President Fraga was of the opinion that it was time for a change, if only to bring the country back into the 20th century. Whoever was given the job of spearheading the modernization effort would have to weather the storm of criticism from both the hardliners and the opposition liberals. Fraga would have to find a man of intellect and grit equaling the task.\n\nHe found such a man in Jose Luis Villar Palasi. Previously a minister in the old regime but now a supporter of Iberian democracy, Palasi was a soft, gentle man, unassuming and bespectacled. But underneath that veneer hid a towering intellect. Palasi was a polymath, speaking over 15 languages, and was known for his love of philosophy, economics, and law. And most important of all, he was a modernizing conservative, determined to bring the Spanish education system up to date with the latest trends and practices while maintaining its religious and civic character.\n\nPalasi's General Education Law passed easily through the Council, supported even by members of the opposition Unión Republicana. Its effects were sweeping and immediate. Archaic schooling practices such as Latin lessons were done away with and replaced with useful activities such as sports. Classes in religion would continue on and the Catholic nature of Iberian education would be maintained, but the influence of the priests and nuns would be curtailed in favor of educated professional teachers. Social science, philosophy, economics, and politics would be taught for the first time, and a unified system of standardized testing would ensure every student had a chance of going to university.\n\nAlready immensely popular, the reform has even won over some of the government's detractors, and made Palasi a household name."

A commonly held opinion within the party is that this upstanding moral character is too clean - and someone who strives so hard to appear honest is certainly hiding something. The train of thought that the Opus Dei is a fraud was something that was prevalent in far more places than ever expected, from a primary concern to a shred tucked in the back of their mind.\n\nIt wasn't hard to reach a consensus that something ought to be done, and so an audit on the Opus Dei was arranged. There was an issue, however. Because of their nature an investigation won't be able to hit everything in a reasonable time, and so to have even a chance of something substantial the investigation must be carefully directed. Suspicions are raised the most in two locations: their finances, and their political connections. Examining their financial connections is risky, as their threat is something any savvy politician knows, but if something is turned up then it could be decisive in discrediting the Opus Dei. Looking into their political connections could expose any ties with political parties that may be present, but if they have taken sufficient precautions then it's likely that nothing could be found regardless.

For hours the Alianza Popular party room had been engaging in one of the most fractious debates of its short history, split down the middle on its approach to the government's policy concerning women's rights. Before now Fraga and his cabinet had seen fit to avoid the question entirely, seeing it as a divisive distraction from the government's current legislative program.\n\nYet a small faction on the left of his party, led by popular journalist and writer María Victoria Fernández-España, had now raised the issue in the party room. Representing the small number of female Alianza Popular deputies, they were loudly calling for the government to encourage women to enter the workforce and break down traditionalist gender roles passed down from the old Iberian regime. Usually, Fraga would have been able to safely ignore them, but much to his annoyance, his secondhand man Jorge Verstrynge had already waded into the debate, backing the women. He would have to deal with Verstrynge's insubordination later, when this mess was over.\n\nThe hardliners were responding as they always did, suggesting that if the government conceded to the feminists they would soon be demanding abortion rights, the right to divorce, and the legalization of adultery, all fundamental challenges to the status of Iberia as a Catholic country. Their rhetoric had now begun to take on hyperbolic proportions, arguing that any movement of women into the workforce would undermine the Iberian family unit, the fundamental building block of Iberian society, thus resulting in social degradation and ultimately collapse.\n\nThe President had stayed out of it until now, hoping that the discussion would cool and they could move on to more pressing matters, but there seemed no end in sight. He would have to take the podium and intervene in the debate, lest the party tear itself apart. His word would ultimately settle things, with the center following his lead.

Democracy had been restored across the peninsula, new modernizing reforms were being passed almost every month, and the whole country was imbued with a renewed sense of optimism and hope for the future. Yet in the dark and musty courtrooms of Iberia, one felt transported back to ages past. Strict, archaic statutes, some dating back as far as 1944, continued to land a great many innocent Iberians in jail, while the courts were packed with apparatchiks of the old Falangist order.\n\nThe government's New Penal Code put an end to all of that. Hundreds of judges and other court officials associated with abuses under the Caudillos have been sacked, replaced with a new generation of young lawyers. A series of vital democratic reforms have been implemented, ensuring the accused the right to free legal representation and appeal, while also stripping the military of the right to try its members in secret military courts. Freedom of assembly and press are enshrined in law for the first time in decades. Jose Luis Villar Palasi, a legal thinker as well as an education reformer, has earned himself and the government much praise for his role in devising the new system.\n\nYet not everything has changed. Adultery, abortion, and divorce remain illegal, along with a whole series of other statues regulating sexual and social freedom. The death penalty will continue to be enforced for heinous crimes. The right for workers to associate in a union remains nebulous at best, and the police have as much power as they ever did.\n\nPresident Fraga and his party toe a fine line. Iberia must be free and democratic, its courts a beacon of fairness and equanimity on a continent gripped by extremist insanity. Yet it must also remain strong and just, ensuring the social and institutional fabric of the country, already so fragile in the aftermath of the Iberian War, remains intact."

A great number of them had voted for him, mostly because they believed he and the Alianza Popular represented a cautious, conservative choice for Iberia, a sort of halfway house between the old dictatorial regime and the new fledgling democracy. Many knew he had served briefly in the old regime as Minister for Information and Tourism, yet few Iberians recognized his face in the newspapers, and even less knew what his voice sounded like.\n\nFraga wanted to change that. If he was to be the man who led Iberia into its future as a modern democratic nation, he had to be a constant source of inspiration and comfort. Yet so many simply saw him as just another collaborator. Speaking directly to Iberians in their homes via the radio, he could give them his side of the story.\n\n\"Fellow Iberians,\" he said, beginning his address to the nation. \"I am speaking to you today to address my role in the old regime. I say to you today, as I have always said and always will say, that I am for a free, united, and democratic Iberia. Yet I believe we must remember the chaos which engulfed our homeland in these past decades. The regimes of Salazar and Franco arose in situations of anarchy across the peninsula, when the forces of extremism threatened to bring civilization toppling down. They united to form Iberia when under attack by those same forces of tyranny. Without these harsh measures, Iberia would not exist, and I would not be here talking to you today. Despite this, the violence and brutality of the old regime was unconscionable, and many mistakes were made. Some will ask why I do not feel guilt for my involvement in the regime of Salazar and Franco. As any who was there at the time can testify, I advocated long and hard within the ranks of the regime for democratic reforms, at risk to my own career and self. If the end result is Iberia, secure and free as it stands today, then I say I would gladly do it all over again.\""

 IBR.5050.t:0 "A Catholic Nation"
 IBR.5050.d:0 "The Catholic Church has always had deep roots in Iberia, dating back all the way to the Reconquista. As a consequence the nations of the peninsula have historically been unparalleled champions of the Catholic faith, and Catholic orders of all stripes have played an important role in governance and politics. Democratic Iberia is no different, and a number of Catholic organizations play an important role in Iberian politics.\n\nOne such organization is the Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei, made up almost entirely of laymen and secular priests not tied to any monastic orders. Though deeply religiously conservative and supportive of Church doctrine, they were ostracised by many Falangists in the old regime who believed that Opus Dei was a covert front for freemasonry. Since the fall of the old regime they have become increasingly popular for their role in various charity efforts and sponsorship of universities.\n\nYet recently they have developed some very controversial ideas. While they recognize that Iberia is and must remain a Catholic state, they have shocked many right-wing Catholics across the country, and their liberal-minded Jesuit rivals, by supporting efforts to expand the freedoms of religious minorities in Iberia. Their leader and founder, Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer y Albás has argued in his most recent book that \"pluralism is not to be feared but loved as a legitimate consequence of personal freedom,\" concluding with the slogan: \"Long live students of all religions and all ideologies.\"\n\nThis turn has caused serious tensions within the government. With the question of religious freedoms being talked about openly on the streets, pressure is being put on President Fraga to take a side. Either risk losing the support of Catholic hardliners within his own party, or risk alienating a sizable portion of Iberian Catholics. A decision will have to be made, one way or the other."

 IBR.5054.d:0 "When the investigation began it wasn't sure what the Alianza Popular wanted to find. Perhaps it was some incriminating documents, or some other scandalous piece of evidence. Their conditions were strict - not many people approved of an investigation into an institution of the Catholic Church, and so it took a lot of compromising to even get an approval into order.\n\nFaced with only a small amount of time, hostile oversight, and overly stringent standards the investigation team was left with the shaft. Even if they didn't, it's hard to tell if it would make a difference. The Opus Dei were to set an example in everything they did, and the audit finds that they did just that. Patrolling their records sent one the impression of a freshly-sponged room, so clean it reflected back at you.\n\nIf anything, the most notable thing to be found in the results is this cleanliness itself - no other organization carries themselves in such a wonderful manner."

 IBR.5055.t:0 "A Connection Between PRD and Opus Dei?"
 IBR.5055.d:0 "Working against time and excessively restrictive regulations, our investigators have prevailed. The reception to the idea of investigating a Catholic institution was received poorly, no matter the contents of their doings. As such, the only way even so much as a cursory glance could be approved was to compromise heavily, leading to a shackled audit. Therefore it was necessary to focus on one certain aspect in order to have any chance at a real breakthrough.\n\nTo our delight, pooling the resources into the investigation of the political ties of the Opus Dei has revealed a possible connection. It is a thread, weak and barely present, but nonetheless tangible. One of the main opposition parties, the PRD led by Alberto Ullastres, may possibly have a connection with the Opus Dei. Some even suspect they are nothing but their puppets! With this lead secured, what remained was to validate it by a rigorous investigation.\n\nThere are multiple ways an investigation into this possible political tie can be conducted. The easiest method would be to just conduct an expansion of the previous investigation, with formal support and a shield in the event of unexpected circumstances. However, this may not be enough. Attempting to go through legal channels, while sound, could allow for the Opus Dei to cover up any evidence they might have waiting to be used against them. To counter this a more illegal solution could be utilized, breaking into their headquarters and finding their documents before they could be hidden. It would be disastrous if word of this would get out, but the possible reward is far greater. How will we investigate this possible connection?"

After all, a formal investigation necessitated an announcement, which could give time to hide any incriminating evidence. It wasn't strictly legal, but you had to get your hands dirty to clean filth, right? There was a simple plan: a double agent would be recruited somewhere from the shadowy organization, find some documents, and report back with them. The kind of documents needed were very specific in nature - it had to be a collection important enough to be indisputable, while still proving a dedicated tie between Opus Dei and the PRD. Finding someone of absolute loyalty to the coin, however, was harder said than done. Once found, this double agent would use the plans as a checklist of sorts for the discovery of the necessary documents.\n\nNo questions were asked, and no answers were given. Payment was rendered for a service well performed. After this, the Alianza Popular's leadership was left with their prize. The evidence contained within was damning. The Opus Dei and the PRD were very closely linked. Their connection was, for the sake of legitimacy, kept carefully covered up. Especially surprising was the plans to cover up this connection, which were as extensive as they were detailed. These plans would be released to the public, and used to kill two birds with one piece of paperwork."

Taking this as an opportunity to discredit our government, what got leaked instead of the internal documents was our plan to expose them. This has been a total disaster!

 IBR.5058.d:0 "Minority regions all over Iberia - Catalonia, the Basque Country, Galicia, among several others - are at a standstill following co-ordinated protests and sit-outs everywhere from businesses to governmental buildings. The populations of these areas are all in uproar following our recent legislation. According to various sources, they do not feel that we represent a party of Iberians, but of a party of Spanish. Since they did not vote for a Spanish party, we have effectively lost the minority vote.\n\nOur recent steps to grant token autonomy to minority regions is the source of this damage. As opposed to just being grateful, they have instead been outraged that we did not give them more. Because of our unwillingness to grant them the mile, they have taken the stance that we do not represent them. The resulting protests, most likely egged on by separatists, have crippled any productivity the minority areas could muster. Eventually this will all die down and things will be back to normal, but the expense of these disobedience campaigns will be one that will take much longer to resolve. Worse, we've probably lost any respect they've had for us."

 IBR.5059.d:0 "The military holds undue influence over the Iberian police force, a hold-over from Franco's days. Part of our platform has been demilitarizing the police, and creating a second force independent of trigger-happy generals. Since the military has been as effective as they are, this is a difficult policy to justify. Why change the makeup of law enforcement if it works fine as is? Nevertheless, despite the grumbles the police had been on a fair track to being separate from the armed forces.\n\nMaking the case for this has become significantly harder as of late. As law enforcement has been transferred to civilian oversight, the police forces have gone rampant. Reports of brutality have risen significantly, and professionalism and morale have taken a nose-dive. With such happenings it is far more difficult to make the case that the military should not enforce the law, since they seemed to have kept a tighter grasp on the police. Without it, they look to be just a bunch of animals."

 IBR.5060.d:0 "Ever since Franco seized power from the Second Republic, the peninsula has had to deal with hordes of separatists, utilizing terrorism in their campaign for independence. This legacy of bloodshed has continued on to Iberia, and we have been shackled to it as well. Even though Iberia is a free republic now, many of these terrorists simply haven't gotten the point. In nearly every minority region separatism has taken a major hit, but still holds a monumental popularity among some segments of the people.\n\nMost of these people will never take any action to further the cause they support, but there are those who will go so far as to sacrifice their lives for a misguided campaign. Usually they're just arrested. This action, while effective, is not entirely sustainable. These terrorists will just remain in prison, until they are broken out by their cohorts and returned back to causing chaos on the streets. Only one thing can definitively rule out this possibility, and it is their death; but killing the terrorists brings on a whole new debate.\n\nHow shall the Axencia eliminate these people? The most practical option would be to just kill off anyone suspected of being a separatist. This could prove very messy, and is highly risky. However, it would eliminate all of them far faster. Alternatively, we could send in hitmen to eliminate them quietly. This has far smaller odds of causing a stir - after all, it's only a couple of criminals - but would take far longer to properly be rid of them all. Finally, we could back away from this plan and leave them be. Nothing wagered, and nothing lost. But nothing will be gained either."

It took less than an hour to have everyone brought out in handcuffs, after which the area was left desolate when the figures sped off. They were off to the nearest prison, where the workers would be held until they could be proven innocent of the terrorism charges laid against them.\n\nIn regions all across Iberia, this had become common occurrence. Companies and buildings suspected of hosting terrorists were raided, and the suspects within removed, forcibly if need be. The Union was cracking down on separatism, and not even a single possible criminal was left. No stone went unturned in the pursuit of these men.

A quick glance to the security cameras revealed that the staff were either dispatched, taken hostage, or losing their battles. As he turned towards the local radio he reflected on how it got this far. One of his comrades had been arrested, and was able to warn of his danger. Since no man is to be left behind, a rescue needed done. It was easy to get in, and even easier to push the prisoners into a riot. Off their backs, anything was possible. Speaking of which, he needed to put this out to the world. The insurgent switched on the radio, composed himself, and began speaking about injustice and extrajudicial killings by the government.\n\nAccording to witness reports, an unknown insurgent group attacked the Carabanchel prison in Madrid, the most infamous prison in the capital, and released all its prisoners. With their assistance, they were able to massacre almost every guard and nearly managed to broadcast their accusations over the radio network. Thankfully they were cut off before such a thing could happen, and the public is none the wiser of the events that triggered their assault.

While not a first option, lethal force was to be used on anyone who overly resisted. Bringing in new guards would be an issue, but the local law enforcement and Guardia Civil could serve in their stead for the interim. In theory, the inmates would be pacified and back in their cells with minimal casualties, and in no longer than a couple of hours.\n\nIn this particular instance, theory was far detached from reality. By some unknown factor - though insider assistance is most likely - the ringleaders of the riot were not dispatched, and the special forces were pitted against a crowd of angry inmates hungry for their freedom. The prisoners were no match, and were eventually pacified. This took many more hours than originally estimated, and the bodycount was easily more than triple the original estimate. As these kinds of incidents always do, this was of course leaked to the press.

The insurgents went down without so much as a peep, and without their ringleaders most of the rioters surrendered without a fight. Faced with only a fraction of their initial opponents, the riot was quickly brought to a close.

Typically the longer lasting a scandal the larger impact it makes, but this was a relatively recent altercation which caused a disproportionate stir. One of the hitmen has been arrested, using evidence we were not able to remove from the occasion. Currently incarcerated, something needs to be done before he exposes the entire system.

Pensioners, the sick, those with disabilities, the unemployed. Austerity was certainly necessary to stop an economic crash created by the Oil Crisis, but we have to recognize how unpopular the cuts are.\"\n\n\"They are only temporary,\" Fraga scoffed. \"And what can we do?

Yet still, Fraga had not expected this much opposition, let alone at a cabinet meeting.\n\n\"We have no choice,\" Jorge Verstrynge responded, taking point and showing Fraga why he kept him around as his second-hand-man. He really was quite invaluable in a debate. \"The Oil Crisis has seriously depleted our treasury. If we don't raise taxes we will not be able to pay our debts. We are facing a sovereign default.\"\n\n\"To hell with that,\" de la Fuente retorted, now turning and pleading directly to the President. \"If we need more money, we have to find it elsewhere. It is hard-working middle class people of Iberia who support our government. Raising their taxes will be a stab in the back. I guarantee you, Mr. President, that if we do this our own supporters will throw us out at the next election.\"\n\nFraga knew there was some truth to what de la Fuente was saying. The traditional middle class base of the Alianza Popular wanted to see less taxes, not more, and support for the government would atrophy as a result.

Driving the unions underground during the old regime of the Caudillos had only made matters worse, inflaming radicalism and posing the interests of the state against those of the working man. That is why he had been pushing for labour reform in the Alianza Popular government, trying to convince President Manuel Fraga to support his changes. So far he had experienced some success. The unions were no longer underground, and he could negotiate openly with their leaders, yet just enough of the restrictions from the old days remained that the state usually had the upper hand. Just how he liked it.\n\nBut the Oil Crisis and now the Public Sector Strike had ruined his plans. Forced to implement sweeping privatization programs in health, education, and even welfare and pensions to raise emergency revenue and cut down on bloated public spending, the government had now triggered one of the largest public sector strikes in Iberian history with tens of thousands of public sector workers demanding a reversal of the privatization scheme and the restoration of government funding.\n\nAs he sat in his office preparing to meet with the union leadership, de la Fuente tossed up his options. He could tell the unions they would not be getting a deal, and push ahead with his orders to enforce the privatization. He would almost certainly have to deploy the Civil Guard to crush the strike.\n\nOr, he could get on the phone right now and call the President. Up until now Fraga had respected his remit on labour issues. More importantly, Fraga himself, while deeply worried about the economic crisis, seemed more concerned with avoiding further rifts within the government. De la Fuente knew that if he asked Fraga to moderate the privatization scheme, he might just acquiesce, if only to avoid a split. Whatever de la Fuente's choice, he would have to act soon."

Meanwhile the economy was in freefall, unemployment was at an all-time high, and the state was facing financial ruin. If things did not improve, and soon, Manuel Fraga knew that he and his government would be facing catastrophe. Yet in the meantime, support had to be shored up. Speaking directly to the people, as he had done many times before, was his best and last chance.\n\n\"Fellow Iberians,\" he began, addressing his countrymen in his customary manner. \"As you are all aware, the country finds itself in the midst of a deep economic crisis the likes of which it has never faced. We in the government are well aware of the suffering this has generated amongst broad layers of the Iberian people.\n\nIt is for this reason that the government has pursued a policy of austerity, to make sure that the state, which protects and provides for all Iberians, continues to be able to function. These measures are temporary, and were employed with the greatest possible reluctance on the behalf of myself and the government. In this time of difficulty and struggle, we must all band together as Iberians, tighten our belts, and make sacrifices for the greater good of the country.\n\nMany think that the threats to the security and peace of Iberia have disappeared in this time of economic crisis. They have not. Marxian extremism, totalitarian threats from abroad, and seperatist terrorism may yet return to Iberian shores in this period if Iberians do not remain vigilant and united. In the years of democracy we have built a new, modern Iberia. Now I am asking all Iberians to help defend her, to put the needs of the country and community first.

In the same league is of liberalism. The adherents are misinformed, brainwashed into something evil by anarchists. Regardless, the how and the why hardly matter, beyond a reason to oppose their cruelty. It has to be handled with great care, in order to ensure the campaign isn't sabotaged. Every good crusade has a specialization, and there are two specializations that are practical for antiliberal use.\n\nThe most obvious path is to eliminate the corruptors at their core, and destroy the spread of influence by removing the people who spread it. This will have to be handled quietly, as any major disappearances could cause a major catastrophe if exposed. Alternatively, the influences could be quelled by a propaganda campaign. If we choose to use propaganda, there is no guarantee that the influence will be effectively countered. However, there would not be as much of a backlash from the campaign.\n\nResources are limited, so there is only the time and budget to do one of the two. The choice needs to be careful.

The specifics were simple in concept, but creating a robust framework to operate in was challenging. The propaganda would be vast, all-encompassing, and sustained for maximum effectiveness. Only one last hitch remained before finalization: how would this all be directed?\n\nThere is no denying that separatists can draw from areas outside of the regions they claim to represent - more than once has a non-minority been arrested for working with terrorist groups. Are they more of a threat than the minority forces of these groups? The resources behind the propaganda program are limited, and we cannot hit everywhere at once. We can target the individual minority regions, and cut off the main source of the terrorist manpower. If we so wish, the program could be put across Iberia as a whole. While it runs the risk of being less effective, it also provides a justification for having the propaganda elsewhere too."

To do this, the organizations must be destroyed from within, in order to sabotage their effectiveness. However, Where will the infiltration begin? The groups in question have many tendrils, in many separate parts of Iberia. It is disappointing but necessary to realize that the Axencia lacks the resources to combat all of it at once. For anything to get done, attention needs to be honed in on one specific spot.\n\nOf the myriad of facets, there is one in particular that gains the attention of criminals: universities. The impressionable, young minds are perfect for propaganda. If we were to plant agents in undercover areas then we could catch separatists red-handed. A riskier solution is to attempt to break into the terrorist groups themselves, sabotaging them from inside.

They do not worry, because they do not believe retribution will not be applied to them.\n\nThe change in perception can be reversed by vigorous application of propaganda and other methods of spreading information. It will take time before the flippant disloyalty is corrected, however, and it will take many resources to do so."

Given recent circumstances, that has changed.\n\nThe thrift which so characterized the Axencia shortly before is gone. On average, they go through more equipment and more men than they have ever before. Since they are still operating on the relative shoestring of a budget they have always had, this means they have taken a nosedive as an effective force.

Enforcers can become a bit too zealous, and carry out their duties with more than a little too much pleasure. This is when things go too far. The most pressing motivation to stop this is how it makes the government appear. When an over-use of force isn't reined in, it makes for a very bad look. It makes the administration of the Caudillos seem brutal, cruel, when in reality it is nothing of the sort.\n\nThis sort of happening is nothing new, but what is new about it is the frequency of its happening. It seems that more loose cannons, more shoot-first types have found their way into law enforcement.

What they want is more difficult to determine, but it can't be good. Liberalism will dissipate and the people will return to their natural way of thinking, if the sources are cut off. To cut off the source, the head of the snake will be removed. This is no snake, however, it is a hydra. Like any hydra, it has multiple heads, and only one head can be cut off at a time.\n\nThe intelligentsia are one of the most troublesome heads of this despicable hydra, and easily the most vocal. Their calls turn the populace away from their benevolent leaders, and silencing those calls will go a long way to bringing back the natural order. The intellectuals are very entrenched, so removing them is certain to cause an uproar. An operation with less risk is to target the downright treasonous elements of the government. These politicians are attempting to bring the Union down from inside its own administration. Removing them will fix any degenerate shifts the government might undertake. As well, they are not as popular as their intellectual cousins. It is also possible to target the terrorists further, who are in cahoots to help push the propaganda onto good citizens.

So far, they have not been able to prepare beyond a basic level, since the Axencia lacks critical details. Namely, how they are to strike.\n\nSeveral general predictions have been drawn up, and the one approved will be what the Axencia uses to stabilize Iberia. The first plan was to use stealth in order to get things done. Accidents, assassinations, and all sorts would be used to eliminate without causing an uproar. While suspicious, it could be effective. Alternatively, others have advocated the use of a velvet glove - force is not strictly necessary, and the targets will realize that. Working with them while also making sure they know of the violence that could be leveled at them could be very effective, making collaborators out of rivals.

The view on the ground was a bit messier, but even against all the mess it was still the same underneath, but with a few extra steps. Get briefed, go to the location, take down the door, always the door, then drag a fellow or a few more out kicking and screaming.

Nor have we also been sent a letter decrying that we have \"betrayed the very ideals that Iberia and its governance was built on\" or any other such rubbish. These men know better than to further directly challenge our authority, it was ourselves after all who stopped the renegade Falange some time ago, but that doesn't mean they will not scheme against us. These dinosaurs of yesteryear may not look like much but they are heavily experienced in the political game. Some noise is likely to be created amongst the most zealous and hard-line in the faction but the rest will likely bide their time, waiting for an opportunity to trample on the process.\n\nIt is quite likely that we will not be able to rely heavily upon the conservatives as their support for the process dips with their lack of faith in us. Whether this vitriol will remain the tantrums of old men or morph into something far more seditious and dangerous remains to be seen. What is known however, is that the old guard is not happy and likely won't take this decision lying down."

 IBR.5103.t:0 "The Regional Debate"
 IBR.5103.d:0 "Perhaps the most contentious issue in the process is the issue of separatism. Basque, Galicians, Catalans etc. all have made the claims for nationhood and have sometimes used violence as a means to achieve their goals. The history of this issue is seemingly everlasting, it has become ingrained beneath the very skin of Iberia. Many have died fighting for and against the ideals of the separatists but a radical option of paying heed to the separatists is now available. So too, is the option to shut them out once again.\n\nOn the one hand, listening to the separatists and giving them a real Special Regions programme would perhaps allow for the future of Iberia to remain stable and whole in the end. Terrorism would hopefully eventually cease and the needs of these people will be placated within a deal we could hopefully reach with them. On the other hand, giving any sort of leniency to their demands may set the dominoes off and foresee to the balkanisation of Iberia. Whatever decision we make we are bound to upset someone. But we must do whatever's best for the future of Iberia so disaster does not strike in these world changing times."

 IBR.5104.d:0 "It once seemed like a pipe dream that the Caudillos would even consider notions of regionalism in the nation of Iberia or even in the previous nations of Spain and Portugal. Time and time again the despots, the monarchs and the governors of Iberia's past had ruthlessly crushed separatist dreams. In response the separatists turned to politics by way of the gun and a seemingly everlasting cycle of violence began to grip Iberia. Now, however, the cycle may just be starting to crumble.\n\nWith a promise of listening to the regionalists and considering their demands for a real Special Regions programme, the separatist movements have now been forced to take the process seriously. A real breakthrough may arise from this, it has been enough to make any hard-line separatist zealot think twice about any would-be terrorist attack. While the issue is certainly not been put to bed, a clear expression of confidence in the process has been given by the regionalists. By proxy, this means some confidence has also been given to this governance.\n\nHowever, this decision may come at cost. There are many in Iberia who would rather die than see the nation break up into pieces. Indeed, some may believe that this olive branch to separatism will hasten this. Of course, this is nothing but the delusions of staunch paranoia but we must be wary. Not only of the separatists but of those within our own governance as well."

 IBR.5105.d:0 "Iberia is one indivisible and eternal nation. There will be no entertaining of separatist notions that would lead to certain doom. This goes double for the treacherous separatists in Spain who once worked as a heathenish Bolshevik fifth column. We have not forgotten their treachery and to placate them now would let them simply bite the hand that feeds. Its simple, you give these deserters an inch and they'll take a mile. We completely and utterly reject their demands that would have seen Iberia crumple into a failed state.\n\nThis has of course not gone down too well with the separatists who were sticking their neck out talking to the government in the first place. Now it seems we're back to the usual cycle of terror. The more militant and radical elements of the various separatist movements have apparently been \"proven right\" by our response and more attacks are likely to follow. Let them come we say, for we have faced them down once before and will do so again. The separatist may cry and stomp their feet but they will not tear apart this great nation. We, with all our might, shall see to it."

 IBR.5106.d:0 "With the process chugging along, the technocrats aligned with the Opus Dei organization have sent out a plea wishing for the furthering of their involvement in the process. Believing that the process apparently needs a \"qualified voice\" to speak up on certain matters, they have sent in a number of proposals that they seek to bring to the table. One such proposal they are particularly pushing is the improvement of civil liberties for Iberians.\n\nOn the outset, these proposals seem all well and good but God knows what these people are truly after. One thing this process cannot allow for is the fifth column to arise once again. It occurred once before and it took the strength of an entire nation and a sea of blood to stop the fifth column antagonist. That being said, it could be worth placating these people if we are to embark on real reform in Iberia. These technocrats could certainly prove to be a key part of the process if we are to take them, and their proposals, on board."

Socio-economic liberalism has seemingly been given the all clear, now the floodgates are open for the rest of Opus Dei's proposals. The decision to take in Opus Dei and their opinions has caused no shortage of hoo-ha amongst the more conservative sections of Iberian political society. This matters little though, for the process requires the means of all qualified voices in Iberia. The Opus Dei are to be welcomed on board and bring a hopefully healthy element to the Congress.\n\nThe Opus Dei have of course been nothing but grateful of the opportunity provided to them by the Iberian government. This gratefulness has been showcased by their entrenchment of support for not only the process but also the government as well. The technocrats will certainly have to prove their usefulness as the Congress will soon evolve into its most crucial stages. In any case it is hoped that the technocratic expressors will bring something new and fresh to the table."

 IBR.5108.d:0 "The rejection of Opus Dei and their proposals has not gone unnoticed.

For it was obvious to everyone what the Opus Dei's proposals of so called \"civil liberties\" and their hoity-toity pretensions of qualifications actually meant. This technocracy is simply the scourge of uncontrolled liberalism disguised and thus, the Opus Dei have been put in their place once more.\n\nThis calculated decision has not gone without its consequences though. Any hopes the Opus Dei had in the government and the process has been slashed considerably. Any support we could count on from the technocrats has near evaporated but, we have done what we must to keep Iberia safe and secure from the ills of liberalism once again. We make no apologies and Opus Dei should now hopefully know better than to get considerably involved in matters that in actuality know little about."

 IBR.5109.t:0 "The Armed Forces' Role"
 IBR.5109.d:0 "The situation in Iberia today is far removed from the past and these testing times have clearly influenced Iberian political society. For example, it has become a common belief within certain sections of the Iberian government that the nation is under an existential threat from the forces of terrorism. It has been alleged that Bolsheviks and separatists have ran rampant in the recent past, beseeching our great nation with the horrors of urban warfare. There has thus been a clear worry that the current process will not only not stop the terrorist threat, but also increase it as instability grows in the nation. It is through this worry that the military and its most staunch supporters have stepped into the limelight.\n\nThe military very clearly want to have a voice in the current ongoing debates. They, of course, claim they only wish to do so in order to stave off the threats of instability and terrorism. The more cynical amongst us however, deem that they only wish to do so in order to keep hold of their power and stop any sort of reform to the armed forces. Their intentions certainly seem to be wholly political rather than mere love for the nation, Iberia of course having a clear history of military involvement in political affairs. This occasion seems no different but we could put a stop to their meddling in an obvious showcase of our commitment to reform. That being said, capitulation to the armed forces may be necessary in order to stop any separatist threat or leftist plot."

 IBR.5110.t:0 "A Very Liberal Indignation"
 IBR.5110.d:0 "Our agreement with the armed forces has clearly rattled some feathers in the Iberian Congress. The more liberal elements amongst us have kicked up an almighty storm in the debates that such an apparently \"craven\" deal could be struck with the alleged \"authoritarian despots whom have next to no regard for democracy\". Resignations and walkouts soon followed after the tantrums which all had one clear message. A glaring lack of faith in this government to deliver any \"meaningful\" democratic reforms.\n\nBut why should we pay heed to these flabby and naive liberals. It would seem from this kicking and screaming that the liberals would rather our nation succumb to socialism, separatism and subjugation than to give the armed forces a deserved role. These men are amongst the most principle among us. They bravely did what was necessary once before to send to Bolshevik menace packing and put separatist notions back in their desired place. So sure, the liberals may be unhappy with our decision but the nation will be thankful for our decision to bring the heroic military fully on board."

 IBR.5111.d:0 "The decision to so blatantly tell the army and its political backers that they are not needed nor wanted in the political process has went about as well as could be expected with the military and its supporters. Incensed that such a snub could occur, the army has \"expressed its deep disappointment that such a decision was taken\" but so far that has been all they have done. They have been clearly stopped where they thought they could succeed; the yes men of previous administrations have evidently made them arrogant towards us. Now that they have been told no, like an opulent child they cry out against the rational choice. They will now need to reconfigure but this gives us more than enough time to figure out how to truly sap their power if need be through this process.\n\nHowever, this decision has also irked the military's conservative backers who have likewise expressed a definite voice of a lack of confidence in ourselves and the process. It's plain to see they don't have what it takes to stop Iberia from falling in on itself, so latched onto a past that no longer exists, but it matters little. The process shall go on with no insidious meddling from the armed forces."

 IBR.5112.t:0 "Broadcasting the Debates?"
 IBR.5112.d:0 "A question has remained ever present throughout this whole process, it teeters on every meeting and talk that has so far been held. Precisely what is democracy and what should it entail? Well certain liberal adherents believe it entails one key feature. The people and their input. In order to envision a truly democratic reformation process, it has been recommended that the final debates should be broadcast to the whole public to show transparency and a genuine commitment to democracy. All in Iberia, be they rich or poor, Spanish or Portuguese, conservative or liberal will be able to watch the most important debates and no doubt voice their opinion towards the results.\n\nThis huge spectacle could have drastic ramifications. While it may show the government has faith in its people and shows an attempt at making a connection with them, it could also cost us dearly. Should the debates go smoothly we have little to worry about, but if they end in disaster then God knows what the consequences will be from the public. Instability is already too high and this just might push Iberia over the edge. We could keep the debates behind closed doors as a precaution but this may also give off signs to our true feelings towards this process."

It was a message to the whole of Iberia that perhaps the most important event in its history was about to take place. People first whispered about it, somewhat in disbelief, and then they began to shout about it. For the Iberian Congress was about to broadcast its final debates to the entire nation for all of the public to see.\n\nTo those born in the Caudillos' Iberia, the proposal seemed foreign and alien yet exciting. A new development that would give a leashed public a legal voice in the proceedings of the nation. To those much older who had seen a society much different from that of Iberia today, there was cynicism but some couldn't help but be optimistic. Maybe, just maybe this could be the real deal.

Decades long ramifications may occur from these debates going one way or another. All will be decided as the Council convenes for this great meeting.\n\nAmong the councilmen ranked the most important players in the ongoing political process. The highest esteemed representatives from the technocrats, liberals, conservatives, army, and regionalists have gathered to shape the future of an entire nation. We have come too far and sacrificed too much for this great day to descend into petty squabbling, for all of Iberia is counting on this Council to deliver something that would stop the bloody decline of Iberia. Iberia has seen itself through violent separatism, civil war, treachery, public strife, the Bolshevik and German menace but it could slip up now and forever remain a shell of its former self.

Led, directed and whipped into action by the technocratic faction of the Council, a proposal for the strengthening of civil liberties has found its way at the forefront of debate proceedings. Opus Dei's liberal allies have helped along with this process which could change the very nature of the future Iberian regime. For decades the nation has been ruled by strongmen and their hegemonic grasp on civil society. Now, that power could be broken as the right of the individual look to be ratified under these reforms.\n\nThe reforms are no doubt drastic, a total overhaul of the former principles of Iberian civil society. The reforms are sure to find their antagonists in the army and the conservatives but for now the reforms seem to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. If the current proceedings occur without and hiccups, then the technocrats and their allies will have accomplished a remarkable victory with this legislation."

And my fellow Iberians, is it really necessary to embark on such a wide ranging and tiresome debacle on civil liberty reform? Would it not be so, that this complete uprooting and overhaul of Iberian civil society would leave us weak to the scourges of separatism and the fifth column threat? The Council it seems is certainly of this same opinion, with an agreement recently being reached concluding that there is no need to quickly make any sweeping changes in regard to civil liberties. The antagonism of the conservatives and the army would no doubt have reached dangerous heights if the Council as to embark on such an all-encompassing reform. Drastic measures are to be left aside as compromise, it is hoped, will be the theme of the debates.\n\nOf course, certain liberals and Opus Dei sympathizers do not quite see the drafting of these scaled back reforms the same way as the majority of the Council. There are cries of a deliberate shut down at an attempt of real reform and the scuttling of a chance for Iberia to become a new society. This view though is as utopian as it is naïve, these liberals are far too narrow sighted to see the larger threat any drastic reform could deliver to Iberia's doorstep.

The militarists have made their contempt known, citing that the proposals from Opus Dei and their allies will make Iberia unsafe. Clearly wishing to play on the threats from Bolshevism and separatism, the army have stated that they would be unable to fight off the dangers to Iberian society. It soon became clear as the heat rose in the Council that with every utterance the militarists made against the proposal, the less chance any sort of compromise could be reached.\n\nThe technocrats fought back against the accusations, defending their proposals and stating that the militarists \"only sought to keep a stranglehold on their despotic power of Iberia\". With the debate raging on, it soon became clear to all those who saw that the Council was marred by factionalism.

The liberals have held their ground in the proceedings though, coming straight back at the conservatives and condemning them as \"tired-out tyrants only looking to keep the Iberian people down and themselves afloat\". At one point the debate looked so viscous, it was a surprise chairs were not thrown between the two competing sides.\n\nIn the end, there appears to be a considerable amount of pushback from sections of the Iberian pollical class against these reforms.

They have long called out against the fifth column element of sinful separatism, naming it as one of the biggest dangers to the nation. This paranoia has previously led to the lack of any self-determination or minority representation in the Iberian sate. This though, could be about to change.\n\nWith the usage of their cunning political skills and dextrous tactics, the regionalist faction in the Council have managed to gain sizeable momentum behind their attempts to pursue a Special Regions programme. The programme would result in a real and new change for the Iberian political system, with far greater autonomy being granted to Iberia's minority regions. The success of the regionalists can surely be attributed to their strong connection to the dreams of autonomy. While some still say they pursue a hidden agenda of fully-fledged separatism and the disintegration of Iberia; this has not been shown in the Council as the Special Regions programme looks set to be passed."

It would be a surrender to the terrorist pest, it would see the emboldening of political violence and it would be the end of a project we worked so hard to build and make a reality.\n\nIt soon became all too clear to the majority of the Council that the regionalists had a hidden agenda of unabridged separatism and their proposals of a so called \"Special Regions\" programme needed to be shot down with haste. However, the regionalists and their wishes could not be just disregarded at will. This is a new Iberia after all. So, it was the Council's preference that token autonomy would be the solution to the minority question. This was of course a rather vague and unenthusiastic proposal that may well be seen through but it was decided that this was far superior to giving in to the regionalists and their alleged fifth column thought."

Any previously comradely discussion in the debates would be eviscerated and forgotten about if clashes arose over allegations of separatism and tyranny. This, it appeared, was precisely what happened when the militarists gave their response to the regionalists proposals.\n\nThe militarist reply was lengthy, brutal and uncompromising. Militarist, after militarist, arose to shout down the regionalists calling them \"terrorist sympathizers\" and \"the hideous face of separatist treachery, hidden behind a suit and tie\". Man, after man, gave speeches that stated that \"Iberia would never give in to terrorism\" that \"the nation would remain strong in the face of separatist terror\" and \"would smash down the terrorist instead of succumbing to it\".\n\nThe regionalists were, of course, appalled by these allegations and threatened a walk out due to the tirades of the militarist faction.

With the discussion of the apparent regionalist proposal of a \"Special Regions\" programme coming to an end, the conservatives would have one last say before the end of the proceedings. These final states would, as it turns out, scupper any remaining hopes of a functional debate over the regionalist question.\n\nThe conservatives clambered up to speak their minds with little care for what the regionalists thought. In a brazen statement to the rest of the Council, the conservative faction voiced that the proposed reforms are completely unacceptable because Iberia is only the union of two countries and there cannot be any real special status for other \"groups\". With complete disregard for the demands of the regionalists, the conservatives stated that \"Iberia is indivisible and immortal and will not play into the hands of little pests with grandeurs of nationhood.\"\n\nAs was expected, the statement received an immediate kickback from the regionalists who called the conservatives out over there \"blatantly offensive and callous remarks\".

 IBR.5126.d:0 "It was once the word on the streets that a great change was coming to Iberia. People had started to talk about freedom, openness and a new start. It seemed as though after decades in political purgatory, Iberia could re-emerge from these debates as a fresh forward-thinking ideal, that could unite people in its spirit.\n\nThis, to say the least, has not occurred. In fact, quite the opposite has befallen upon Iberia. We have been made to look like coños in front of all our people. The constant bickering, the blatantly unhealthy clashes and the lack of anything even resembling a consensus has stifled any hopes that this process first brought about. A clear lack of any sort of resolution has been emphasised by critics of the talks, along with the constant fighting that accompanied the debate proceedings. Now, the message being passed around the public is one of failure and disdain. It seems the incompetence displayed here has made the public even question our legitimacy not only to pass change, but to even keep Iberia stable.\n\nThe lack of any clear vision for Iberia's future is deeply concerning yet we must find a way to press on. A different strategy is needed and new ways of thinking may have to emerge or confidence in the Iberian mission could fall to a dramatic point. Press on we shall, but we now have quite the hurdle to overcome."
 IBR.5126.a:0 "We will overcome, God is with us...isn't he?"

 IBR.689.t:0 "The Madrid Families Festival"
 IBR.689.d:0 "An unfortunate fact of the modern world is that many, even within Iberia, have forgotten the importance of a morally righteous family. To help remedy this issue, a great festival was organized in Madrid, celebrating the Iberian family. It seems to have worked, too - crowds of thousands attended, from Madrid and areas across the country. The festival began in the early morning, with all present taking part in a great mass dedicated to the concept of the family, and of its virtues. The schedule was designed to resemble the cycle of life, and to that end the first third of the event - from morning to noon - was dedicated to the children of Iberia.\n\nChildren played games and activities designed for their amusement, all while being lectured on their importance to the country. The parents were not left out, and were able to pass the time by taking advice on the best kinds of \"family equipment\" to raise children with.\n\nThe midday was directed to the parents, with several hours of speeches about the importance of their role in the family. There weren't enough guest speakers to cover the entire time, so most had to draw their speeches out as long as possible.\n\nFinally, the ceremony came to an end with a celebration of the elders. After stressing the importance of respect for one's elders, the most important elders of all - the Caudillos - personally performed the closing ceremony."
 IBR.689.a:0 "It is remarkable, how such a small bond can cause such great things."
 IBR.691.t:0 "Iberian Woman Appreciation Day"
 IBR.691.d:0 "A woman must fulfill her roles in society, for a society to function. They were noble jobs, and to help emphasize their importance and nobility, it was decided that an entire day be dedicated to the appreciation of a woman's importance to society.\n\nThe main bulk of the event was organized through the efforts of the Sección Femenina, with Pilar Primo de Rivera leading the event in Spain and Cecilia Supico Pinto representing it in Portugal. The event was celebrated by recollection, contemplation, and faith. Speeches were delivered by the government representatives in each city in the Union, planned to give two final ones in Madrid and Lisbon respectively. Special masses were held in cities across Iberia, where the priests were able to explain the importance of the women's role in bearing and rearing children, securing the next generation of citizens.\n\nThe festivities were cut short when several self-proclaimed 'feminist organizations' started marches in cities across the Union, ruining the celebrations through disruption. Even though most protests were successfully halted by police actions, the protests in Madrid and Lisbon proved volatile enough to necessitate evacuating both representatives."
 IBR.691.a:0 "Such a nice day! Not even the protests could change that."
 IBR.5130.t:0 "Hierarchy and Society"
 IBR.5130.d:0 "Society requires a hierarchy. Human nature dictates that there must be a pyramid at the center of every state - at the top the leaders, and below them the decreasing rank and increasing size of the lower classes. This is how any good state functions, and Iberia is no exception. In order to show our appreciation for these natural laws, we must incorporate them into many of our daily actions. The only question is how.\n\nThe degree to which we recognize the fundamental laws of hierarchy will make a great difference. If we desire to have more heavy-handed dealings, we may enforce this idea formally. If not, then we may simply encourage the populace to follow it while doing so ourselves."
 IBR.5130.a:0 "The aim of this state is to reinforce them."
 IBR.5130.b:0 "It is a nice idea philosophically."
 IBR.5131.t:0 "Maintaining What We Have"
 IBR.5131.d:0 "The Opus Dei has once more petitioned our government to pursue economic reform. Their incessant requests have turned out to be rather persuasive, and regardless of if it was out of a desire to quiet them down or of genuine conviction, a not-insignificant amount of the government has turned out in support of their economic reforms.\n\nThe Opus Dei, backed by their government benefactors, wish for us to move away from our policy of economic autarky and instead conduct a decisive shift to a more open free market model. Should we listen to them? They have drafted a plan to make a gradual change to their preferred economic model, but for all their posturing we still don't have to oblige them."
 IBR.5131.a:0 "More autarky, not less."
 IBR.5131.b:0 "There will be a measured transition."
 IBR.5132.t:0 "Restructuring Unfair Systems"
 IBR.5132.d:0 "While some things are not actually problems, it would be downright stupid to assume that there are no problems within Iberia. Taking these smokescreens and assuming they are the case for every reported issue would be a straight line to the death of Iberia. The minority regions of Iberia face problems and unjustified oppression, rooting from issues designed to suppress them as a people. These systems will need to go.\n\nIn order to make sure the minorities do not get preferential treatment, we will need to determine the extent to which these systems need to be revised. We could probably relieve most of the anger against the government by some token funding, though some more may help keep the complaints away better."
 IBR.5132.a:0 "Do what we can to rectify these issues."
 IBR.5132.b:0 "Allocate some funds, but not too much."
 IBR.5133.t:0 "Toning Down the Rhetoric"
 IBR.5133.d:0 "Look at our older speeches, of the language used, of the way the documents refer to things. Our language is causing problems. The way the Caudillos speak in public appearances, the way the state press prints reports, above all else it is inflammatory. This tone inspires unrest, as it creates the perception that we are wholly uncaring of their presence.\n\nIf we were to drop this language, then governing the country will likely become easier. We will find many more agents and supporters where we would have once alienated them. Would it be better to drop this language entirely? It would be more work for a benefit that would be around the same as just cutting some of it, which would force less change onto the status quo."
 IBR.5133.a:0 "No more inciteful language."
 IBR.5133.b:0 "Anything too explicit is off limits."
 IBR.5134.t:0 "Results of the Investigation"
 IBR.5134.d:0 "After much delay, corruption, and red tape - all of which is now resolved, for the investigation's sake - the investigation into the minority regions was finally completed. We took careful polls and encouraged that opinions be submitted, and carefully compiled them into various categories of complaints or opinions. Once we had filtered out the low-quality or obviously terrorist poll responses, the results were, to put it lightly, less-than-ideal.\n\nWith their wants and desires firmly on record, we can start to take actions to resolve them. However, the question still stands about how much we should hold ourselves to these resolutions. If we are totally set on fixing the issues, publishing the findings publicly would serve as a motivator, as they would expect us to fix them all. Were we to keep the results private, then we could do as much as we please and call it the necessary amount."
 IBR.5134.a:0 "Have these findings published."
 IBR.5134.b:0 "This might hurt our reputation..."
 IBR.5135.t:0 "The Presidents' Speech"
 IBR.5135.d:0 "The radio crackles to life. The man on the other end, in a voice so monotone it would take practice-honed talent, announces the beginning of a speech. The Caudillos had something to say, and it was urgent enough that it could not wait to be scheduled. With this in mind, most of Iberia had tuned in to listen to the two leaders speak.\n\n\"Citizens of Iberia,\" spoke the two men, their voices so alike once they spoke together. \"We have decided that, following careful discussion, we are no longer simply Caudillos. We have been named the Presidents of the Iberian Council, a position which we additionally will hold until further notice.\"\n\nThe Presidents spoke some more, sometimes swapping the speaking position, of topics that were far less related. Finally, they finished. With the long announcement concluded, everyone present in Iberia found themselves forming an opinion. When everything was said and done..."
 IBR.5135.a:0 "Iberians welcome their guidance!"
 IBR.5135.b:0 "Most Iberians look to be on their side."
 IBR.5135.c:0 "Their words did not seem to rile up the people."
 IBR.5136.t:0 "Power to the Regions"
 IBR.5136.d:0 "At the time, it seemed like centralizing the bureaucracy in the two capitals of Iberia - Madrid and Lisbon - was an excellent idea. There was a Union to be kept together, after all, so why wouldn't the heads need to know what the arms were doing? As it turns out, trying to figure out what all the arms were doing, our many flailing arms, has caused Iberia no small amount of grief. The bureaucracy is frequently swamped, and trying to keep up with the many requests piled on it has caused it to fail to actually accomplish anything in a reasonable time.\n\nBecause of this, decentralization is our best option. If we were to hand more powers to the provinces, they could handle their day-to-day affairs on their own, as well as easing the present social tensions. While they will not be federalized - we are not liberals, after all - giving them a bit extra power will ease the central administration's workload. How much would be best to give them?"
 IBR.5136.a:0 "Decentralization is the goal."
 IBR.5136.b:0 "Limited power, but power all the same."
 IBR.5137.t:0 "Power to the Regions?"
 IBR.5137.d:0 "Iberia has had a questionable relationship with minorities. From Franco's oppression to our paternal watchmanship, the many minorities around the country have more than likely developed a resentment of the Union. If we were to give them the option, then, they would nearly certainly split away from our state. Are we really sure people like this should have more power? The threats to our national security could be intense.\n\nOf course, if we give them some limited power, then the minorities could be sated a small amount. Giving them too much would kill the Union, but a token level of power would serve to stop any complaints that we are oppressive. Still, there is always the option to disregard what they think..."
 IBR.5137.a:0 "Local legislatures, but limited power"
 IBR.5137.b:0 "Actually this is all mainly rhetoric..."
 IBR.5138.t:0 "A Fundamentally Broken Political System"
 IBR.5138.d:0 "Iberia has been on a shaky footing ever since its inception. Through well intentioned but misplaced policies, decisions made more to sate egos than to help the country, and corruption so thorough it would make president Nixon blush, a country has built its foundations on sand. Some of the decisions the Caudillos made, though sensible at the time, are better off reversed. It seems like the only way to save the Union, is to open up some more politically.\n\nWe need to do something politically. We have our best chance at saving the country by increasing its representation and making those present eager to participate. There are a number of tabled reforms we could pass, though thoroughly overhauling the system could work even better for our ends."
 IBR.5138.a:0 "A thorough overhaul is in order"
 IBR.5138.b:0 "Let us get through the tabled reforms"
 IBR.5139.t:0 "Improving Representation in Iberia"
 IBR.5139.d:0 "Iberia has run just fine ever since the Presidents opted to merge their countries. There have been a few hiccups here and there, and the government is not without its problems, but they have been moved on from and fixed, given time. This is the nature of the Union - it is never perfect at first, but can improve to be near it given the right attention. Some do not get this, and these people, often minorities, will agitate for our destruction. We need them to be silent.\n\nThe best way to silence these pests is not the stick, but rather the carrot. By passing some limited political reforms, we could go a long way to bringing dissent down to acceptable levels. How much would be best? We could work through a backlog of tabled reforms, or simply target the most critical policies."
 IBR.5139.a:0 "Start working through the tabled reforms."
 IBR.5139.b:0 "We should probably focus on the most important ones..."
 IBR.5140.t:0 "Surveillance for the Greater Good"
 IBR.5140.d:0 "Democracy is all well and good as a system, but sometimes it can produce unfavorable results. Above anything else, an election's primary purpose is to legitimize the regime in the eyes of the people, and if we allow ourselves to be voted out then it fails to accomplish that. We need to ensure that the people - or enough of them - vote for the right choice.\n\nWe will be deploying agents to most major polling stations, and there they will establish themselves and keep a very close eye on the voters. In addition, wire-tapping of election workers is to be conducted with state of the art technology purchased from the United States. Our electoral plans depend on enough information being revealed through constant surveillance. Hopefully, the systems already in place will not obstruct us."
 IBR.5140.a:0 "但愿这能奏效……"
 IBR.5141.t:0 "Everything According to Plan"
 IBR.5141.d:0 "Of course, what we wanted done to polling stations was not necessarily legal. If we were to blatantly compromise a perceived anonymity, and even more through breaching legal protocols and precedents, it would create an impressive stir among the public. The matter required sensitive handling, and no small amount of work from our bureaucrats to ensure that our aims were implemented correctly and the laws budged to make them legally bulletproof.\n\nWe should have never even thought of doubting our bureaucratic strength. Loyal to the Presidents, and with a skill to match it, we now have careful observation firmly established over most polling places, allowing us some influence over how people vote."
 IBR.5141.a:0 "Now, about those voting booths..."
 IBR.5141.b:0 "All in a day's work."
 IBR.5142.t:0 "Stronger Electoral Control"
 IBR.5142.d:0 "In a society like Iberia's, it is the duty of the stronger leader figures to guide the lesser masses. This hierarchy is known by all from the lowliest janitor to the Presidents themselves, and the average people accept the guidance of their betters. It is not only accepted, but even desired that the state provide a basic framework for people to do their civic duty within.\n\nThrough this unspoken consent to provide direct help, many facets of the polling stations - including the voting itself - are under our influence. We have the ability to control the ballots themselves, and by combining this assistance with our previous surveillance, very little will happen during an election that we do not know about. The public supports this move, and thanks to that it will be able to last for a long time to come."
 IBR.5142.a:0 "It's harder to do something about the turnout rate..."
 IBR.5143.t:0 "Attempts at Monitoring Elections Blocked"
 IBR.5143.d:0 "It would be a bad idea to simply declare our elections monitored. By taking such a decisive course of action, and in the process break many established norms, we would set ourselves up to alienate many who would otherwise support us. Setting up surveillance on most polling stations around the country would be a delicate affair, leaning mostly on the competence of our bureaucratic services to ensure that things are as they should be. If they are not swayed, then we cannot do anything.\n\nGiven the current results, the bureaucrats do not act with Iberia in mind. Unable to actually deny our requests, we have fallen victim to the timeless political maneuver that is not actually doing what we desire. They claim that they cannot make progress in surveillance due to complications in protocol and paperwork - conveniently leaving out how they are responsible for most of it - and even create more when they can excuse it. Political surveillance, it seems, is further from our reach than anticipated."
 IBR.5143.a:0 "Really? Perhaps their budget needs some surveillance as well."
 IBR.5144.t:0 "A Plan for Election Results"
 IBR.5144.d:0 "Ultimately, an election is an event where the people decide who they think should be in charge of a country. This can be very good for us - the majority wants us, after all - but that same system is a double edged sword. If we were to be voted out, unlikely as it is, then we would be in the uncomfortable position where giving up power would be expected. It would be a nightmare, so we will need to make sure the sleep is sound.\n\nMost of the troublesome parts of democracy can be avoided if we place the people in an advisory role, allowing their decisions to guide us but not order us. Then, we can claim all the benefits of public support and none of the drawbacks of losing it. If we are confident in our support, then we could just allow elections to proceed unimpeded."
 IBR.5144.a:0 "The people's decisions should ideally be binding."
 IBR.5144.b:0 "The people guide, but do not rule."
 IBR.5145.t:0 "The Party Question"
 IBR.5145.d:0 "Iberia's newfound reforms has set many important precedents in its political scene. Dissidents speak more freely now, and ideas that would have been met with hostility are now simply points to be considered. The reformism has brought an entirely new dimension to the business of policy, as anyone with a lick of political sense can see that the environment is definitely changing. One of the new issues buzzing around is that of political parties.\n\nDo we really want more political parties? Iberia has been run by a single party - the National Union - ever since its inception. The argument has been made that allowing the creation of new political parties may be just what the country needs, as their limited dissidence will do wonders towards discharging much pent-up tension. Could these parties be what Iberia needs to save itself?"
 IBR.5145.a:0 "Iberia benefits from multiple parties"
 IBR.5145.b:0 "That is one step too far..."
 IBR.5146.t:0 "Presidents Speak in Favor of Parties"
 IBR.5146.d:0 "\"After careful consideration, we find that Iberia must evolve to hold more political parties than simply the state. We not only condone the creation of these political organizations, but as Presidents and Caudillos we will take steps to assist in the creation of more, for the good of Iberia...\"\n\nWithin mere minutes of the announcement, Iberia found itself in an uproar. The Caudillos, of all people, supporting a multi-party system? It was ridiculous. As it later happened, this event proved the fertilizer for the Iberian political scene to blossom, as the endorsement from the very Caudillos themselves led many to flock to political parties. Democracy had a new vigor now, stronger than it ever would have been otherwise."
 IBR.5146.a:0 "Everyone comes around to it eventually."
 IBR.5147.t:0 "Internal Transcripts Leak"
 IBR.5147.d:0 "\"Don't you think a non-binding election would cause an uproar we can't handle?\"\n\n\"Who cares what the people think? What will they do, vote us out?\"\n\nLike all internal meetings, transcripts were kept of the entire meeting. The subject of democracy did not come up just once, but several times - and frequently in the same fashion. One would bring it up, and then another would deride the very concept. It would be quite damning, were it not a private meeting.\n\nLike all things best kept private, it didn't stay that way. Our bureaucrats, whether by incompetence or malice, have managed to have our internal transcripts leaked to the public. Before, we had a level of plausible deniability, but now we don't even have that! The public is angry at our approach, and there's nothing to suggest it will subside."
 IBR.5147.a:0 "白痴！"
 IBR.5148.t:0 "Protests for Binding Elections"
 IBR.5148.d:0 "The people of Iberia have turned out in force. In crowds of thousands, protestors march through the cities of the union. In smaller numbers, these same protestors also march through the countryside - presumably to join their urban brethren. It is everything the Guardia Civil can do just to keep these protests from exploding into riots.\n\nThese protests are in response to our recent meetings, nicknamed the \"autocracy admissions\" by the media. They are protesting for legally binding elections. We cannot disperse crowds of this magnitude, there are simply too many to try it without starting a true revolution; our only hope to keep the status quo is to ignore these protests for long enough that they fizzle out. When this happens, nobody knows."
 IBR.5148.a:0 "Find some meaningless scandal to throw at them!"
 IBR.5149.t:0 "Moving Towards a Multiparty System"
 IBR.5149.d:0 "Even today, the word of the Presidents is supreme. As they say, then so it shall be done. Their will is law. So when the Presidents decided that Iberia needed a multi-party system - a real one, not a sham democracy with a controlled opposition - then it was decided then and there that Iberia would have itself a democracy. No matter the surprise, or the confusion, orders were orders.\n\nDrastic reforms are being written up, and are only a rubber stamp away from approval. The old laws, limiting Iberia to only one effective political party, will be repealed as soon as possible. With the new political diversity, Iberia is well on its way to becoming a democracy. This is a very big step, big enough to catch the eye of many within and without the government."
 IBR.5149.a:0 "Change is coming to Iberia."
 IBR.5150.t:0 "The Rise of the Parties"
 IBR.5150.d:0 "For a long time, Iberia has had no formal political parties. Crushing restrictions have choked them out, leaving nothing but a few fringe groups to organize underground, where they were by and large irrelevant. With the new reforms, other parties are finally beginning to form, diversifying our political scene. They are young, embryonic, and inexperienced. This could be an opportunity like little else.\n\nAgainst our apparatus, which is finely tempered by the rigors of political life, these new parties would have little resistance. If we were to actively campaign about them, then we could keep them weak and marginalized. However, we would be seen as more legitimate if we allow them to grow and become relevant entities."
 IBR.5150.a:0 "Tell Iberians that competition is healthy"
 IBR.5150.b:0 "Campaign Against Them"
 IBR.5151.t:0 "The Party Growth Slows"
 IBR.5151.d:0 "It was well known within the government that the parties would eventually stop growing. No-one could attract a universal appeal, and once each party found their entire base, they would plateau. The only question was where - would they be irrelevant, would they be present, or would their combined strength be enough to challenge, or even topple, the regime? Few could provide a definitive date, though it seems like they won't need to.\n\nThe new political parties have started to grow at a slower pace, and with the rate steadily declining they are set to likely plateau in a short period of time. It seems our advice on competition was taken to heart, but not so much so that we face overwhelming threats. What now?"
 IBR.5151.a:0 "The parties need some help gaining strength."
 IBR.5151.b:0 "The strategy worked, we can relax."
 IBR.5151.c:0 "Strike them while they are weak!"
 IBR.5152.t:0 "The Party Growth Slows Greatly"
 IBR.5152.d:0 "We have had our plan succeed, not quite beyond our expectations but certainly optimally. We have campaigned against the other parties in Iberia, exposing their faults and flaws to the public. It has worked. The other parties, unable to put up a competent resistance to a real campaign, have mostly folded and do not attempt to counter our media - not that they could regardless. Their growth has slowed dramatically, and it looks like they will plateau far lower than the extent required to challenge us. With this taken care of, what should we do next?"
 IBR.5152.a:0 "The strategy worked, we can relax"
 IBR.5152.b:0 "Strike them while they are weak!"
 IBR.5153.t:0 "Propaganda Perceived as Weak"
 IBR.5153.d:0 "When we first ordered a campaign in place against the new political parties, we were assured they would be squashed. Our political influence was strong and enforced by veterans, surely there would be no failure. All they needed was a little bit of time to work their magic. As it turns out, we should not have trusted these men with government positions.\n\nThese men are veterans of politics, but it turns out that this means nothing but their time present. They have turned out an incompetent, disconnected campaign. We put our trust into these people and the most they could turn out was pitiful, obvious propaganda that failed to appeal to even the lowest common denominator!"
 IBR.5153.a:0 "Let's see if their successors can do better."
 IBR.5154.t:0 "The Party Growth Increases"
 IBR.5154.d:0 "As if a failed campaign wasn't bad enough, things have gotten even worse. The propaganda itself has been turned into a selling point by opposition parties, who have taken its disconnected, out-of-touch rhetoric and proclaimed it a reason to oppose us. The public seem to have caught on very easily to this particular piece, for the opposition had a much better campaign staff than we did.\n\nWith our inexperienced new employees, we are unable to stop or reverse this change of events. The parties are growing even more than before - and they are drawing even from our base of support."
 IBR.5154.a:0 "Really?!"
 IBR.5155.t:0 "A Final Blow to the Opportunists"
 IBR.5155.d:0 "Finally, Iberia will be freed from organized dissidence! There are many opportunists in the country, full of arrogance and greed. They thought that they might be able to take over the country, now that we have shown openness and tolerance to them. Whenever they are presented a potential opportunity, their first thought is to take advantage of it, rather than showing gratitude. This blind, heedless political opportunism will prove to be their downfall.\n\nThis time, there is no openness and tolerance. In our most genius move yet, the new openness is a trick. We will use it to lure the vultures out, promising a wonderful political carcass, and now that they have taken the bait, sweeping in for their opportunity, we will destroy them. They will not see it coming, as they are arrested and their movements destroyed while they are still vulnerable. Iberia will be saved!"
 IBR.5155.a:0 "Nothing gets the blood pumping like a good crackdown."
 IBR.5156.t:0 "The Parties Crushed"
 IBR.5156.d:0 "It is done. The dissident opportunists have been crushed. They were so caught up in their insidious plots to destroy the country that they never saw our crackdown coming. Their greed kept them blind until the last moment, where the ringleaders only realized the error of their opportunism once they were being driven off in handcuffs by the Guardia Civil.\n\nThe Presidents's control over Iberia is secure once more. These parties will never be a threat again, and their movements will wither and die like a bird without its wings."
 IBR.5156.a:0 "I'm not sure what they expected."
 IBR.5157.t:0 "Parties Slightly Weakened, but Relevant"
 IBR.5157.d:0 "The parties have not been defeated, like we wished. Despite our efforts to find and arrest the ringleaders, and otherwise sabotage their efforts, nothing has proved as effective as intended. This is not due to any particular resilience on their part - they were still taken by total surprise - but due to our own poor planning. Due to several regulations, technicalities, and plain legal obstruction, we could not entirely remove the opposition's political influence.\n\nIn any case, it is certainly not a defeat for us. They are still weakened, unable to exert the influence they could previously. Our actions may have given them a few more supporters than before, but what does that matter when they can't leverage them?"
 IBR.5157.a:0 "So long as we're still on top."
 IBR.5158.t:0 "Crackdown Blocked by Institutions"
 IBR.5158.d:0 "A disaster is unfolding! When we moved to arrest the worst of the dissidents, we found that we couldn't. They were immune to our crackdown, carefully leveraging the laws of our own government against us! The worst among the worst even had the nerve to gloat about it, knowing that we could not reach him.\n\nOnce we went back to the drawing board, we set our bureaucrats off to change the laws sufficiently for a crackdown - but nothing came of it. The bureaucrats have ignored our orders, and we don't have the power to make them heed what we say. We have been betrayed by our own government, so who knows what is going to come next?"
 IBR.5158.a:0 "This was unexpected."
 IBR.5159.t:0 "Pro-democracy Protest in the Capital"
 IBR.5159.d:0 "\"I assure you Marcelo, the situation here is under control\" Fransico Franco said, speaking to his fellow Caudillo over the telephone. \"These protests are stunts organized by fringe radicals, nothing more. I have been personally assured by the Guardia Civil and the Madrid Garrison that all is well. Give it a few days and the crowds will disperse.\"\n\nFranco knew he was only telling Marcelo Caetano half the truth. The situation was well under control, but the protests in Madrid were hardly composed of fringe elements. Thousands of workers and students were pouring out onto the streets demanding full democracy, immediate elections, and an end to military impunity. The audacity of their demands scared him, even safe in his fortress of El Pardo. He realized he only had himself to blame for allowing the Council to take steps towards liberalization. He knew it had been a mistake to let them move so fast.\n\n\"Very well Francisco,\" Caetano responded, seemingly assured. \"I have every confidence things will turn out fine. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help.\"\n\nThe two Caudillos exchanged a few more pleasantries and platitudes before hanging up, much to Franco's relief. He detested the idea anybody had power equal to his, even if it kept Iberia united. Yet right now he had bigger problems. Walking towards the window of his office, he looked out at the crowd assembled on the streets below.

 IBR.5416.d:0 "Caudillo of Iberia, President of the Government, Champion of the Last Crusade and Hispanic Heritage. Francisco Franco had many titles, styles, and accolades. \"Lord of Meirás\" was the least well known of these, and for good reason. Franco liked to keep his summer manor in Galicia out of the way, far from the prying eyes and endless churning politics of El Pardo, the Madrid palace where he usually held court. Here he could rest, and conduct his business in peace.\n\nThat is why when reaching out to Opus Dei, he invited them to Meirás, where the hardliners in the Falange could not be a nuisance. The regime and Opus Dei had a complicated relationship. They were loyal Catholics, but their internal secrecy had always spurned on claims from the more inquisitorial members of the Falange that they were a front for Freemasonry. In a country where membership to the Freemasons was illegal, the mere suspicion was reason enough to keep Opus Dei at an arm's length.\n\nBut times were changing. The Oil Crisis had sent the Iberian economy into a deep recession, with nobody in the government quite knowing what to do about it. Franco was in need of new blood, advisors up to date with the latest economic theories. Opus Dei had amongst its membership many fine economists - Alberto Ullastres, Mariano Navarro Rubio, and Laureano López Rodó. Technocrats, disinterested in the petty politics of El Prado who could deliver results and reform the economy on a new, sound basis.\n\nWorking with Opus Dei and its members would have its consequences. The Caudillo knew he would have to put his foot down, stamping out complaints and protestations from Falange ideologues before they could even be voiced. Either that, or the three economists would have to carry out their work in secret, presenting their plans to him at his frequent visits to Meirás. Either way, he was a Caudillo of Iberia, and where he chose to go, Opus Dei, and the Falange, would follow."

 IBR.5417.d:0 "Caudillo Francisco Franco watched as his bodyguard reached into his holster, drew his pistol, and fired a single shot into the head of the horse. The beast fell to the ground unceremoniously and died. Out on his customary morning carriage trip around the grounds of the Pazo de Meirás, his summer palace, one of the carriage horses had slipped and broken its leg. Pitying its pained cries, the Caudillo had ordered it shot. When he was younger he had rode about the grounds himself on the very same horse, yet even that small pleasure had been stolen from him by age.\n\nDuring the carriage ride back to the Pazo de Meirás, the Caudillo once again thought over the National Economic Stabilization Plan presented to him by his new team of economists - Alberto Ullastres, Mariano Navarro Rubio, and Laureano López Rodó. The technocrats' plan was ambitious, proposing a fixed exchange rate, raised interest rates, increased foreign investment, significant cuts to public expenditure, and privatization of key industries. It was exactly the kind of new, pioneering reform that Franco believed the struggling Spanish economy desperately needed.\n\nYet it would also be controversial. The plan went back on decades of economic orthodoxy, doing away with the official policy of National-Syndicalism under which Iberia was neither capitalist or communist, with class struggle abolished and the worker and the capitalist both serving the interests of the Iberian nation. State ownership of industry, national economic independence, protection of the worker: the policies of National-Syndicalism were one of the great legacies of the War of Liberation against the communists, or so said the ideologues of the Falange. To give it up would be to relinquish the power of the state over economic policy and invite pernicious foreign influence into Iberia.\n\nFranco himself was loath to undermine it, at least publicly. Perhaps some compromise would have to be found, in which the National Stabilization Plan was only partly implemented, leaving National-Syndicalism largely intact. But perhaps, like a horse with a broken leg, it simply had to be put down."

Promises that the austerity would only be temporary. Promises that ordinary Iberians would not bear the brunt of the cost for the crisis. Promises that the Caudillo and the Iberian state was there to take care of them. Promises that they seemed more and more unable to keep as the days went by.\n\nThe whole program had been framed in a series of timelines, with several major austerity measures to be lifted when the allotted time was reached. Yet after months and months, the Iberian economy had only marginally improved, with Unemployment was still high and investor confidence stagnant. And all the while, the deadline for the end of the austerity measures was approaching.\n\nThe technocrats had been telling the Caudillo for some time now that their liberalization program needed more time for its effects to be felt, for the economy to start turning around. They had begged for the timelines to be extended, but up till now Franco had refused them. How would he look if he went back on his sacred word to the Iberian people. But now things were coming to a head. He would have to make a choice: betray his word, or risk economic catastrophe."

Hence someone of similar leaning was needed, someone who would be easier to work with and who could be trusted with upholding Portugal's half of the union once he himself would be dead. By suggestion of his advisors António da Mota Veiga had been chosen for this role. A capable and ruthless politician who had enough experience in Portuguese politics to be an essential asset.

Serious doubts were beginning to be raised within the upper echelons of Iberian politics as to whether da Mota Veiga could even be suitable now considering the vast amount of money he had lost the Union. Some analysts have gone so far as to claim that the losses have hit Spain in particular, further deteriorating the situation behind closed doors.\n\nFollowing a week of discussions with Franco, eventually da Mota Veiga was forced to stand in front of the national press and proclaim that his inauguration would have to be delayed due to personal reasons.

Despite the message proclaiming extraordinary measures in uncertain times in a similar vein in which the Union had first been announced, the significance of the political reality that was hidden behind Franco's words were not lost on those watching and listening. The Union was now solely governed by a Spaniard from Madrid. The consequences of this are still uncertain."

Reactions were muted to the extent that public officials deemed that Salazar's death had created a temporary culture of mourning across the Union. The more capable ones however recognized the phenomenon for what it was. The calm before the storm.\n\nFirst signs of protest in Portugal were quickly squashed by authorities. Initially it was solemn and quiet marches in the larger cities that could be dispersed at the first sign of police presence. However, as the days wore on the marches did not stop organising and in fact began to grow considerably in size. Soon they also began to take on a much more radical tone as people began to bring along signs and sang traditional Portuguese songs. Again, authorities were called in to deal with what senior Spanish officials started to call an official show of defiance against the Iberian state. This did not the stop marchers either as their numbers continued to swell and their actions began to negatively affect the economy. Arrests and show trials were not putting off those who were now calling for the formation of an independent Portugal, free from Spanish oppression. Local officials and newspapers began to stop toeing the line officially mandated by an increasingly nervous Madrid. State oppression began to become visible as sweeping arrests were made and curfews began to be set in place."

An unofficial strike has been called with many government workers simply staying at home or joining the continuous marches through the towns and cities. On top of this ministers and high-level officials were handing in their letters of resignation, citing an inability to work for an administration they did not believe in.\n\nThe newspaper censors were working restlessly as most major and minor publications within Portugal were reporting on this mass desertion from the Iberian project. They could not however censor the foreign observers effectively who had begun to spread seditious rumours that army units were amassing at the former border.\n\nAll the while Franco watched his empire burn and crumble around him. His hard work uniting two peoples, his grovelling to Portuguese officials, his compromises while Salazar was still around. All for nothing now that he had made one bad decision. He would be damned though if these traitors would crush his ambitions without a fight. So, he stood over his desk like Nero, singing maniacally in his head as more news of sedition reached his office, waiting for the rot to burn and the just to take their righteous place afterwards."

Yet surprise filled their faces as it was noticed that they had not been the only ones to show disrespect to the council.\n\nAs the Portuguese began to whisper amongst themselves the door opened again and the aging Caudillo marched in, taking his seat at the head of the table. Looking around the room shortly he coughed and began to speak, only to be interrupted by a Portuguese member of the council. The Spaniard's eyes virtually bulged out of their sockets in rage as he waved for the man to continue. Denouncing the inability of the council to restrain the Caudillo in acting against the virtues of unity and shared responsibility upon which the Union had been established, the Portuguese rattled down a list of condemnations to which all his fellow countrymen of the council had put their names to. Even if the council had no real power in stopping the power-hungry Caudillo, they could at least show their discontent. If looks could kill, then the speaker would have turned to ash. The Spanish dictator was not pleased.

Wearing pins of the Portuguese national flag would not change their situation in the slightest. The Spanish Caudillo now held total control after all.\n\nSitting down he observed that his bones creaked slightly; hoping that no one heard he quickly went on to highlight the sessions agenda of topics that needed to be addressed, putting a high stress on foreign policy issues. In the middle of his monologue however, all the Portuguese members of the council stood one by one. As Franco and the Spaniards looked on aghast, they began to slowly filter out of the room without making a single noise. Finally, Franco stood, his face ablaze in fury as he ordered them to immediately return to their seats or have their privilege of advising the Caudillo forever forfeited. A few grimaced as he went on to claim that Salazar would have been ashamed at the childish foolery they were now acting out. Yet none of them even turned to acknowledge the Spanish dictator.

Knowing the problems facing regional representations he recognized his own important role, not just as a competent replacement for Salazar but also in being a figurehead of Portuguese interests in the Union. He was able to ingratiate himself effectively with the members of the Iberian Council. Caetano figured that despite their seeming lack of power in opposing Caudillo decision making that they were still extremely important in the process of smooth governance. If an issue were to divide the two dictators it may also help to gain their support to overwhelm Franco's arguments.\n\nThe first day was over, a flurry of meetings and paperwork to establish his authority behind the closed doors of government in the same way his inauguration had cemented his standing on the international stage through foreign press coverage. A small rest in his new office finally allowed him to clear his mind slightly. He looked out of the grand windows on a bustling Madrid, still heaving with activity despite the late hour.

It set the tone for Caetano's speech after, as many had already left and those who remained only seemed to be half listening. Dejected the new replacement for Salazar had left early, only quietly answering a few questions from the press before slipping off.\n\nHis first day in office was no better as there were still arrangements underway to change the administrative structure in order to erase the last remnants of da Motta Veiga's preparations. Assembling his staff from a pool of trusted and effective civil servants he knew, Caetano could at least start working on healing the ills of the Union. Not surprisingly the scandal had exacerbated many of the issues he would have needed to deal with anyway. Separatists took Franco's first appointment as another sign of Spanish oppression and incompetence, blaming the federal government for not being a truly representative body. Many Spanish, both in government and in the public sphere, however painted da Motta Veiga as a rogue Portuguese agent, a symbol of Portugal leeching off and abusing its position within the Union. Then there were the financial issues which had been incurred by the scandal; the sheer amount of administrative work to first establish the losses and their consequences and then to begin to remedy them was a mountain which seemingly grew exponentially. Yet the reformer had not entirely lost his spirit. No matter how dire the situation may seem with an effective work ethic and constructive solutions anything was possible. And so, he ended the terrible day with the hint of a smile, he was now part of the solution that would transform the Union into a better place."

Only briefly notifying his Spanish counterpart Caetano shortly after establishing the bureaucratic framework for his administration, he set out to tour Iberia. It was necessary to gain a more complete picture of average life and to assess the extent of the divisions were politically unstable for the nation.\n\nOne of the stops he made was in the border city of Badajoz, situated on the left bank of Guadiana River and extremely close to the unofficial Portuguese border. Caetano's motorcade drove through the city making a stop at the bullring, a site where according to regime dissidents the Spanish Nationalists had murdered 100s of Republicans. Choosing to only take a small security detail Caetano then made his way around the streets on foot. He was recognized very quickly, and crowds began to form, following his walk and cheering him. Once he was at the town hall, he requested for a desk to brought out which he sat behind. Motioning for the onlookers to come forward he instructed his security detail to pick out a number of individuals to line up in front of his new desk. He then began to question them in a friendly manner, taking the time to get to know each of the ones picked. Listening to their concerns he made a few notes and asked for their personal opinions on the regime. As none would answer openly he again wrote down a few notes and then made his way back to the bullring.\n\nNewspapers around the country began to follow his journey, documenting each visit and guessing where he would turn up next. Dubbing the event 'Caetano's grand tour' it quickly went down into Iberian conscience."

His numerous visits and attempts to understand the mood and problems of localities around the Union had given him impetus to carry forth his ideas and display them proudly to the various councils and to his Spanish counterpart. It was not his will he was representing but that of the Iberian people. Not only had he effectively positioned himself in his new role, so the general populace supported him, but he also had managed his staff and administration well. This had given him the support of many in the civil service.\n\nHe now stood at the pinnacle, admired by many and without the ruinous taint of scandal. Caetano was positioned to be a unifying, stabilising figure in Iberian politics. His reluctance to immerse himself in the cheap power politicking that Salazar and Franco had been engaged in was refreshing to those in higher office. Seeing a change from trying to gain relative gains over one another to working for the absolute gain of the Union made Caetano one of the first true Iberians. Not a Portuguese nationalist but a product of the ongoing integration between two historic nations. Under his rule the future began to look a little brighter."

A small glimpse at what the union could soon look like if the crisis was not handled effectively.\n\nFranco's message to the nation had been received by many in Portugal as an address to the Spanish people, not to the united Iberia. In protest they had held civil rallies which had just invited the Caudillo's harbingers of order. Retaliation was the only order they managed to establish. Lisbon rose in a violent uproar. The previously civil marches now turned violent as police and security forces began to be driven from key parts of the city. Like other revolts it even inspired many of those who were ordered to quell it to join it. Public services and other semblances of normal life had been abandoned in favor of opposing Madrid.\n\nThis delicate political climate required conformity, it was not simple to craft a state out of the fresh corpse of another. Of course, the sheep would not understand. In situations such as these a strong guiding hand was required to guide them back to their pens, to bliss and safety.

The hardliners on the other side set forth a clear plan of action, almost like a military campaign, in order to not let the revolt turn into revolution. Both sides debated heavily while Franco listened, every now and again shushing one speaker to hear an argument particularly in line with this own thinking. His considerations lasted long, not even being revealed in the space of the meeting. He initially had the plan to converge on Lisbon with the full might of the state behind him, but deeper thinking was required to not be too rash in the decision making.

His eyes widened as he saw a menacing column of armored cars and crowd control vehicles rushing towards the main road, not slowing until people began to scream and back away. As the cars began to disperse the equally armoured Guardia Civil troopers the long line of protestors halted and moved further away. Orders were being barked as the soldiers began to surge forward. Again, people began to scream, this time the whole march was affected. The crowds began to disperse quickly in all directions as the troopers hunted down those defiantly staying or unfortunate enough to be stuck in the middle of the tumult. Within a few hours the guards had established a semblance of control over the city, quickly taking control of vital buildings such as local administration buildings and communication centers.

Yet, despite the initial surprise caused as the soldiers swept into the crowd in full riot gear, they would not disperse. Rather than making room for the Guardia Civil troopers protestors began to throw rocks and bottles, hurling abuse and slogans all the while. As the soldiers barked orders the crowd even surged forward, closing the distance and attempting to disarm them. The situation continued to deteriorate as shots rang out. No one had been harmed yet it had the same effect as if the protestors had lost a number of their own. The shouting and violence worsened, forcing the now embattled soldiers to retreat back to their armored vehicles. Cheering the retreat of their oppressors the protestors began to continue their march only to soon be assaulted by even more riot police, this time far greater in number and with crowd dispersal tools.

Yet that order was hated, now no longer associated with true representation but oppression. As the riot police arrived onto a square which the march was passing through, events quickly began to take a bloody turn. Protestors surged forward with makeshift weapons, trying to mob the surprised security forces and seal off their route of escape. They had however not expected the guards to have real weapons with live ammunitions. The first few shots rang out managing somehow to even surpass the din created by the discord. Dazed for a few seconds the protestors stopped in their bloodthirsty vigour, standing almost entirely still until the first screams rang out. Then the next shots plastered the human mass forcing a frenzied stampede in all directions. The riot police switching back to non-lethal weaponry drove the last few demonstrators out of the square only to find that a good number of them had been killed in the commotion.

His training had been brutal and fear inducing but to now be in the position to translate that into a real-life experience terrified him far more. Finally, his armored car stopped, and the sergeant barked the order for all to rally out. After a long, silent ride with tinted glass windows the sun blinded the young recruit for a short while while the incredible noise of the demonstrators halted him in his tracks. Then, however the adrenaline pushed him forward to stand alongside his comrades, facing off against a wall of seething flesh. He could see the anger visible in their wide-eyed glares and was glad that his face was hidden behind a mask. Suddenly the mass rushed forward. In a panicked flurry he drew his gun. Time froze. The mass abruptly became irrelevant as his entire focus was now on the young woman before him who he was aiming at. No older than he was himself she however stood defiant, inching forwards until her forehead rested against the cold steel. With a start she threw her hands up in an attempt to grab the gun, yet the recruit was quicker. The shot was startlingly loud and the young security man drew in a sharp breath. Time began to move again but now too quickly. All around him his fellow Guardia Civil companions began to shoot too, peppering the now utterly frenzied demonstrators. Yet the recruit could not fire again. His gaze never left the lifeless form before him. Taking no notice of the carnage around him he knelt down and took of his helmet. Putting his gun to the side of his head he whispered a silent apology.\n\nThe massacre in Lisbon was legendary.

The conviction with which they had started their demonstrations against Spanish centralization within the Union structure slowly evaporated day by day with the constant harassment.\n\nOne side had to break eventually and as it was the Guardia Civil's duty to make sure that it would not be them the result was that protests finally weakened.

A senior officer has in this confusion written a memorandum asking for clear measures to be put in place to put the protestors in their place.

The hurried back and forth to convince the various interest groups who still held sway within the Union was exhausting work for an old man. He could not trust many of his underlings to undertake such important meetings on his behalf, continuing to push himself as he knew the end result would give him what he so desperately desired.\n\nA clique he thought he had placated with promises of patronage and other concessions now again rallied against him. Officials and politicians within the rotting carcass of the previously representative Union government were calling for even further compromises to be made in order to limit Franco's power. He had believed that these opportunists would resign themselves to the flow of events once they recognized which way the winds were blowing. The Caudillo was astoundingly mistaken. His weakness in controlling those who should have quickest followed suit was a humiliating sign that his grip was slipping. This would likely have further consequences in his consolidation process."

 IBR.5215.d:0 "It was a lazy, sunny afternoon in the political capital of the Iberian Union. In one of the quiet streets of Madrid there was a small café, its patronage often seemed irregular leaving the place empty for long times on end and neighbours often have wondered how it was still able to survive. Little did they know that this was one of the few designated private spaces for politicians and officials of the Iberian government to meet and discuss ideas away from prying ears. Despite the wonderful weather all of the outside tables had been folded up and the heavy curtains had been drawn. Inside three stone-faced men sat and smoked in silence.\n\nThe Portuguese of the group stubbed out his cigarette and broke the tranquil peace. 'You know this is just a ploy for him to silence our opposition?'\n\n'Obviously. That doesn't mean we shouldn't accept the generous offering of the Caudillo. The man still has the power to make us disappear if we don't cooperate,' his bellicose Spanish counterpart shot back.\n\n'He is pushing the Union into ruin, the masses of Portugal will not follow him willingly and I suspect even if we concede many of our colleagues will continue resisting,' came the cynical retort.\n\nThe last member of the group raised his hands slowly to calm his two friends. 'You sadly are both right. And this is exactly why we cannot risk action right now. If the masses were to lose their potential leaders before the spark could be properly ignited, then Franco would win. We cannot allow this.' His companions considered this shortly but then began to nod in agreement. 'Good. Let us see how much we can draw out of the old man. Our acceptance will ingratiate us further with him also. The more concessions and information we have from him the better our position will be.'"

For each rasping knock at the door his body would involuntarily flinch before he could gather the mental capacities to deal with the next visitor. After yet another such meeting, Franco turned in his chair to peer out of the grand window upon an unassuming and bustling Madrid. Had he made a mistake in finding opportunity in the crisis? Was he too old to carry on his mission alone? Was the world changing quicker than he could follow?\n\nThe questions continued to plague him as he absently minded started to chew on his finger nails. This should have been his hour of glory; the Iberian people should have united behind their hero of unification against the outside threats and internal terrorists. Instead he faced a horrible mix of resistance and selfish toadyism wherever he looked. He however knew he could not resign from the task now; history did not favor those who lost nerve at the precipice. Steeling himself up, he stopped chewing on his now miniscule fingernails. No matter whether his gambit had been a success or not, he now had to deal with the consequences and carry on. This crisis would not fell the great Spanish Caudillo Franco"

That's what Iberians have told themselves and attempted to believe. It seems their faith was not strong enough.\n\nHistory is an anthology of different stories which humanity has told itself to live and work together. Some in this pursuit alienated others to ensure greater cooperation between initial participants. One of these particular stories is that of nationalism. Now this story was in the process of tearing another apart. The Iberian Union, fundamentally flawed since its conception through the contradiction of its insistence upon equal representation, now stood ready to collapse by political and ethnic tensions. The suppression of minority groups throughout the peninsula by the use of state bureaucracy and force has given rise to an ugly hatred of the political structure in place.\n\nMore severely for the health of the Union however was the gambit played following Salazar's death, by an opportunistic Franco to centralise power upon his own person and hence Spain. Many parts of Portugal had in reaction seen economic standstill, and in some cases open rebellion with Lisbon still in flames. The whole region being in lockdown only further catalyzes the fervor of those who believed more in one story than another. Belief, such a strong tool for the betterment of a society, now stood for the unfortunate disintegration of a union of people."

 IBR.5218.d:0 "The realization hurt deeply. What seemed an opportunity too golden to be forgone, now had developed into a crisis quickly spinning out of control. Caudillo Franco had seen his Portuguese counterpart's death as the chance to finally shape the Union to his will and bring it out of the crippling instability that constant debate and vetoes had brought. Believing that his people would welcome the idea was a given. After all it promised progress under the steady direction of a man who had led the Spanish nation out of tremendous turmoil.\n\nHad he been naïve? Of course, Salazar still had many of the Portuguese in his pocket, able to make them dance to his tune from beyond the grave. Neither should it have been surprising that the useless politicians and officials that lined the vast bureaucracy of Iberia would fear for their positions and promptly oppose him. Rather than being localised, the crisis laid bare nationwide opposition and highlighted structural issues which years of political squabbling had not effectively remedied.\n\nFranco knew he now had to swallow his pride or commit political suicide. Before him lay the options for the replacement of Salazar. Only one would now be able to sate the feverous opposition to the regime of Madrid with his calming and reformist politicking. Caetano shall be the next Portuguese Caudillo."

If we were to just plant it down and expect everyone to accept it, then we will create significant unrest.\n\nThe reception of the law will be all propaganda. How we spin the law will have a drastic effect on how it goes with the populace. It is a matter of national security, of course, but against whom? There are two groups who may pose an obvious threat to Iberia - the backroom plotters, seeking to conspire their way to collapse, and the thugs on the streets, trying to intimidate good citizens.

They contend that the deportations are very effective in removing traitorous elements, but that enough are not deported to render the benefit moot. Any enemy left, for example, is a possible terrorist. Leaving them in an accessible prison is just asking for a breakout - and then there would be two in the bush, instead of one overseas.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that many overseas prisons are already at capacity with dissidents.

Along the way, he hears some stories - a misspoken word, participating in a march, genuine terrorism without the proof (but they'd never mention it by a guard). Then they were escorted off to their new cell, where the cold meets its old friend.\n\nAll over Iberia, similar circumstances occur. Men and women are arrested for whatever offense, then only held for a few days before being deported overseas. They are effectively nonpersons, disappeared from everyday life.

Even though keeping so many prisoners of such a type close together is dangerous, the extended guard presence has deterred any resistance.

An average citizen sees the traitors for what they were - bastards, separatists, and threats to their way of life. Like all threats to their way of life, the removal of separatists was celebrated.

As the number increased, so did the unrest. As incidents increased, punishments became increasingly severe for increasingly minor offenses, as a small few tried to cow their numerical superior.

Their frenzy wasn't enough to stop the prisoners, armed with stolen weapons and numbers to beat the guards by a large amount. While some put up a fight, it was only a handful of hours before Tarrafal was in the hands of its former prisoners.\n\nIt appears most guards are dead, having been slaughtered. Those few that remain have been taken hostage, as the terrorists attempt to bargain their life for another.

What they saw was long and bloody, oftentimes bloody enough to give the floor and walls a new coat of paint. Many prisoners were holed up, and the process to get them out was incredibly destructive.\n\nBy the time the prison was Iberian once more, Tarrafal hardly resembled somewhere people would live, let alone a containment area. Combined with the prisoners who surrendered, a hasty provisional prison had to be established.\n\nEven though this was an embarrassing sight, the worst to be caught by the media team was one last prisoner, who had managed to catch a squad by surprise. Screaming one last cry, he killed several men before he could be brought down himself. It is already obvious this man will become a martyr."

They had shields, sure, and they were organized, certainly, but the Guardia had nothing else going for them. Greatly underfunded, they did not have the means to acquire the necessary equipment. No matter how hard their fighting spirit, they simply did not have the means to defeat the protestors. What was a riot soon became a battlefield, and what was a battlefield soon became a rout, as the Guardia realized they couldn't keep up the fight.\n\nThis did not only happen in one isolated street in a city. All over Iberia, the Guardia Civil lost battles with the rioters, as the situation grew large enough to become totally uncontrollable. The public faith in the Caudillos has been deeply shaken by their inability to maintain peace and order, and with how bold separatists are growing this is only the beginning of our troubles."

Perhaps it was a revolutionary zeal, or maybe just the confidence that the Cortes provided them. They stood, with every prod towards them declaring that they would not fold except with the acceptance of their demands. It could have been that they expected this, or more likely they had raided the stored provisions the building held. The revolutionaries waited for several days, refusing to be smoked out. More persuasive means couldn't be utilized, since killing the councilmen was a risk - and it would be a disaster if it happened.\n\nAs the situation stagnated, the environment grew more uneasy. What would this do to Iberia, everyone wondered? Could this be a death blow, or a sign of horrors to come?

Fighting on to the last man, the Cortes was totalled after the last mutineer was pronounced dead. It took several hours to tally up casualties, and worst of all was that many councilmen had been found on the list of dead. Too many. Their bodies could be hidden, but with time their deaths could not be.\n\nThe hamfisted attempt at salvaging the situation had only made it worse, with the damage to the Cortes a monument to resistance, emboldening the separatists with the hope that their struggle was not in vain.

Through careful marketing, extensive campaigns, and plain persuasion, the events have become incredibly popular throughout the country - even before they have even premiered. In every major city, many have prepared their televisions for the upcoming show, and the less affluent have memorized where they can listen in on the radio.\n\nMany are deeply entertained, and with their entertainment comes a much more important factor. They are distracted, their attention spans captured by the flashy show. With their minds occupied, it will be much easier to manipulate the opinions of the public. This could prove a lasting smokescreen."

The date was rapidly approaching, and as it did the event only grew more everpresent, to such an extent that it was near inescapable. Despite all the media, there seems to have only been limited effect. The rigorous campaign has been unable to inspire more than limited enthusiasm, never truly riling up the population enough to excite them sufficiently.\n\nIt is said that an idle mind makes sinful hands. This is true in Iberia, as without the circuses to distract them many have turned to examining the government, and under public scrutiny we are not as free to act as otherwise."

They were flanked by cavalry, who ambled alongside the marching troops. Madrid's streets were very busy all day, even through midday, as crowds watched and journalists sought to record the scene and take plenty of photos.\n\nAfter everything was said and done, it seems that the parade has left an impression on many. The population, already riled up, was pushed into patriotic fervor, and the entire event seems to have become a very positive memory. Even though separatist elements seem unfazed, our military was able to put on a very impressive performance."

 IBR.5325.d:0 "The men march in organized lines, marching as if they were all the limbs of the same organism. Tanks roll behind them, at once both urging the troops on and creating a spectacle for the audience. On televisions all across Iberia, the parade is broadcast live as the military showcases its might. Not harming this, of course, were the news reporters - they had found a particularly flattering angle, and enhanced the parade beyond regular levels using their PR trickery. Not a single thing went wrong all parade.\n\nOf course, the separatists are not terrified by this display, but it has definitely knocked some sense into them. By reminding them of what they are up against, they will think twice before trying to challenge it. The public itself is greatly impressed. It will be some time before people stop speaking of how impressive the parade was."

 IBR.5326.d:0 "In terms of the sheer expense, one would expect the grand military parade in Madrid to have been impressive. If an event would cordon off so much and use so many resources, it was fair to imagine that they were using them all effectively. Of course, it was also fair to reason that quantity was being used to offset quality. The only way to tell for sure was to see the event itself.\n\nAs the soldiers marched down the streets of Madrid to the scrutiny of regular people and journalists, the latter proved true. Despite the flashy ceremonial intent, the execution proved less-than-ideal. The lacklustre performance seems to have encouraged separatists, and they have started to use the poor use of resources by the military as a piece of their rhetoric."

 IBR.5327.d:0 "Every good state knows how to keep itself stable. By baton, ballot, or broadcast, every man can be sold, and selling as many as possible is crucial to the continued existence of Iberia. The way we will do that is by reinforcing state media broadcasts, as to ensure our information is the only out there. Our message is the most important part, as we must direct our media outlets in order to actually affect anything. There are two options:\n\nWe may direct our attention towards mobilizing public attention, to inspire them to act in ways beneficial to Iberia. Were we to make use of public mobilization, it would likely come in handy when attempting to garner public opinion regarding public events. Alternatively, we could make use of subtle propaganda. By nudging perceptions slightly here, and doing so again there, we could slowly turn public support away from concepts we do not support. As well, there is also a third option. Since the media workers are for the most part differing in their specialties, it stands to reason that both could be done at once with the proper resources. What will it be?"

It is an ambitious proposal, for sure, but if it is done right we may be able to potentially take the best of both worlds. Our propagandists are unsure of something, however. They are unsure of how best to execute two campaigns at once, and since we are the ones to suggest it, they also want to know how we expect them to operate. We could combine the two, mixing subtle imagery with inspiring tactics to create a system that could rile up the public without them even knowing it. Alternatively, we could simply hold two separate campaigns. How will we work our strategy?"

 IBR.5329.d:0 "The Iberian Council was our greatest mistake. Even though it was designed solely for advising us in legal matters, it quickly failed to live up to expectations. Worse than that, some parts of the population have latched onto the failed experiment, wanting it and much more from the government. They demand democratic institutions, unaware of what discord they would sow in the Union. Separatists have joined with them, using their underground networks to attempt to amplify the message of the foolish.\n\nIn order to save Iberia from itself, we need to convince the people that these ideals are misguided and wrong. The unclear part of the solution is how. It would be most obvious to launch a grand national campaign, garnering the support of the people and turning it against liberal forces. We need to be careful - if we were to allow such a movement to proceed on totally unhindered it would quickly turn on us. This is why an alternate solution is on the table: It is possible to try a covert approach, infiltrating rebellious media and using it to broadcast propaganda. Either way could work, it is only a matter of choice which could synergize better with our current strategies."

He leaned in once again, speaking into the microphones more.\n\n\"I do not expect you to know the intricacies of politics, and you ought to be unconcerned with them- the Iberian nation requires all hands to be focused on their role, and you ought to do your part. I beg you, fair citizens of Iberia, to allow us to do what we must! We are going to save this country, and with you all, we will make sure it is never torn apart again!\"\n\nThis was not the only speech held across Iberia, and Caetano was sure to do his part, too. The words varied, as did the intended audience, but the message was the same. Iberia needed to stand together, under her Caudillos, and let them save their beloved nation."

 IBR.5331.d:0 "On, and on, and on, continued the campaigns. It was constant, in the form of radio programs, television PSAs, posters, speeches, and even more tactics besides. It was all designed specifically to rile Iberians up. Only together could they achieve victory, said the rhetoric, and many seemed to take the propaganda well. For every piece of material, it seems that even more people were inspired enough to take to the streets.\n\nIn every major city in Iberia, crowds of people have taken to the streets, in grand public demonstrations of support for their Caudillos. They are standing up to democracy, so they say, and countless citizens attend rallies to show their dedication. Very little police action has been necessary - in fact, more law enforcement have been forced to quell overzealous supporters than public dissidents.\n\nAll this, however, is mostly among adults."

 IBR.5332.t:0 "An Uninspired Response"
 IBR.5332.d:0 "All over Iberia, propaganda runs over nearly every medium of communication possible. Television, radio, even by word of mouth. Only together, it says, can we save Iberia. It only grew more intense, but no matter what, the campaign seemed to do nothing. Perhaps it was in how it was delivered, maybe the planning, but no matter what it seemed to utterly fail at truly riling up the public.\n\nNobody seems to be taking to the streets in defense of the Caudillos, roads are usually unoccupied by anyone but those in transit, and rallies rarely attract anyone but their usual crowd. People are unconvinced by our campaigns. They are not inspired, nor are they convinced of the faults of liberalism."

 IBR.5333.d:0 "The youth of those rallying for the Caudillos are not idle. Bustling with the energy of childhood, many have decided to get politically involved, just this once. They have taken to organizing. From universities and schools they gather, getting groups together, preparing routes, and taking to the streets.\n\nIt is being done for our sake. The children and teenagers apply for youth organizations, standing proud and happy at the idea of their energy being expended on proper life skills, and discipline, rather than some rebellion that will get them nowhere in the long term. University students and others of their age come to rallies and separate themselves from their adult counterparts. They participate, adding another grand chorus to the patriotic cries for Iberia - while making themselves distinct, of course. They are standing up against liberalism with their own unique vigor."

They have taken to organizing. From universities and schools they gather, getting groups together, preparing routes, and taking to the streets.\n\nUnfortunately, this is for the sake of opposing us. Children and teenagers avoid their appropriate youth groups, banding together to show their rebellious spirit was not correctly tamed. Even worse, students in universities have mostly turned against the Union. Acting with hostility to law enforcement, they have found that hiding in shells of hatred was not enough. They have taken to the streets, showing up to rallies to counterprotest. The students try to yell louder than our supporters, seeking to drown out any show of support they can. The Guardia Civil cannot stop them as easily, as both sides are aware of what firing on young adults would look like. Using this to their advantage, the youth have made life in Iberia considerably more difficult."

 IBR.5335.t:0 "A Shadow Information War"
 IBR.5335.d:0 "The best way to stop dissidents is to cut off their information. There are several media sources across Iberia - regionalist, separatist, and otherwise treasonous in attitude - that these would-be rebels get their information from. They refuse to get their news anywhere else, so we cannot reach them regularly. Therefore, we will need to get onto the dissident networks. This is the plan - we will infiltrate the worst offenders and slowly shift their perspective on the Caudillos, under the pretense of fairness.\n\nIn slowly changing the information given, we will deprive the worst rebels of evidence in their arguments and change the minds of the more malleable. The people will love us, or they will hate us without reason."

 IBR.5336.t:0 "Slowly Changing the Narrative"
 IBR.5336.d:0 "From our informants come a series of very promising events. Firstly, they have reported that graffiti upon Iberian state media has decreased drastically. Posters are cleaner on average, with vandalized contents reaching an all-time low. In public, those identified as potentially troublesome have appeared more genuine in their praises - it no longer seems coerced. Undercover operatives have corroborated with similar reports. In more private settings, where open opinions tend to flourish, the worst examples of rebellious thought seem to have cooled considerably, with arguments frequently muddying the waters.\n\nThe Caudillos are starting to be seen in a more understanding light by even their dissidents, at least the reasonable ones, and these people have become less inclined to disagree. This success has only been reported on middle- and older-aged adults. How it will come off to the younger sections of Iberian society is yet to be determined."

 IBR.5337.t:0 "Laughable Attempts at Influencing"
 IBR.5337.d:0 "The infiltration has gone as planned. Loyalist agents have found their way into dissident networks, using modified stories and grand - but not totally fabricated - tales in order to sway public opinion about the Caudillos. Designed to rile up those who watched it, the emotion elicited would then be redirected into support for the regime. Unfortunately, nothing has gone to plan beyond that.\n\nInformants have reported that the \"special dispatches\" used to rile up emotion have been perceived as ridiculous, taken as satire or as humor by most dissidents who watched it. Lacking in subtlety, the propagandized reports have failed to shift opinion. It is unlikely we will get another chance at this, and we have failed to garner more support."

 IBR.5338.t:0 "A Closing Generational Divide"
 IBR.5338.d:0 "According to informant reports, the youth of Iberia seem to cherish their Caudillos more than before. They do not have much in the way of definitive proof, however the ways in which younger citizens express discontent - such as vandalism and seditious humor - are reported to have declined. More concrete, probable dissident organizations are reported to have plateaued or even declined in membership. The youth have gotten tired of their treason, likely thanks to our influence.\n\nAll together, the conclusion is that our subtlety has paid off. Because of our effort to specially tailor the message to the youth, the younger Iberians have taken the bait perfectly. Our regime has grown to their liking, with nothing but a coat of paint to bring them along that way."

 IBR.5339.t:0 "The Disinterested Young"
 IBR.5339.d:0 "When the preliminary reports showed no strong change, it was accepted without a second glance. Surely, it was reasoned, this was only because the program had just begun. Waiting for further reports would show the desired trend. Normally this would be so, if somebody had fabricated reports or things had worked as desired. As the results filtered in, and nothing seemed to change, it finally became obvious that something wasn't working. Once the clerks had stopped looking for success, they instead began to look for answers.\n\nAfter much research, they found, without surprise, that the younger segments of the population weren't very interested in our influence. This didn't solve why, to the displeasure of the Caudillos. Facing some proper consequences for failure, the informants have discovered that our influence wasn't popular with the young because it wasn't compatible."

There is prosperity and happiness, and morality to keep it all in place.\" Franco pauses. Some scarce applause comes from the crowd, until people realize the speech isn't concluded. Once it dies down, Franco looks at his fellow Caudillo. Caetano glances around, before speaking himself.\n\n\"It has come to our attention that some- traitors have sought to destroy Iberia.

 IBR.5341.d:0 "Following our speech against the democratic elements of our government, there have been a number of incidents in the government. Several officials, some definitely rebellious, some unexpectedly so, have begun to make a scene by resigning. Normally this isn't an issue, as they can simply be acknowledged and then sent on their way to irrelevance. This will likely not happen this time. Usually, protesting officials take the form of lower clerks or bureaucrats, gears so caught in the machine that nothing happens from them leaving it.\n\nThe resigning cabal is significantly higher in rank than usual, which could give their protests much more credibility. If we do not silence them - for they will undoubtedly speak out - then many formerly high ranking officials will become figureheads, or even worse, martyrs."

 IBR.5342.d:0 "Somewhere in the countryside, a place that looked so nondescript it could have been anywhere, a man faces a reporter, the sort with a penchant for too-many-questions and too-many-answers. The man himself is formally dressed, with clothing that seems perfectly designed to simply melt into a crowd. The reporter does his best to hide the concern on his face as he brings the microphone back to his mouth.\n\n\"Well, that... is something, yes. One last question: Do you have anything left to add?\"\n\nThe official takes the microphone. \"I, uh, think I do. Don't listen to Franco. He is, well, quite simply a snake. He'll stab you in the back and, uh, my message to anyone listening is to get him and the other one gone.\"\n\nThe interview concluded not long after the final statement, as one damning statement after another found their way across Iberia. First across underground outlets, then through more legitimate stations, the words against the Caudillos managed to find themselves reported to many people, and worse than that, they seemed to be listening."
 IBR.5342.a:0 "Bastards, can't keep their mouths shut."
 IBR.5343.t:0 "Protests in Support of Democracy"
 IBR.5343.d:0 "In Madrid, protests were contained early by the overwhelming police presence. In several other cities, the government was not nearly as fortunate. Protests had sparked up, spurred on by the damning comments against the Caudillos, as thousands of people rural and urban alike had taken to the streets in order to defy the government. As the demonstrations were victim to attempted containment, they quickly devolved into plain riots.\n\nThe flash riots took several days to put down. More than that, during that several days democratic ideals had been planted into the populace. Not from any deliberate strategy, but in opposing the government they had come to support what it detested most - democracy. There are now many calls for further freedom, the protection of whistleblowers, and many other liberties that were only conveniences before, but were now mandatory.\n\nThe odds are significant that now, with a populace more conscious of politics than ever before, solidifying our control will be nigh-impossible. Any moves to remove dissidents will be met with outrage, for it seems that most people are more in favor of no Iberia than not getting their way."

One simply looked at him, while the other looked him up and down, before speaking.\n\n\"You are under arrest for treason and the advocacy of ideas destructive to Iberia.\" They placed him in handcuffs and walked him out of the office, as his coworkers watched on with stupefied amazement.\n\nSeveral others were walked out with similar stories - picked up by uniformed men, charges read to them, and then walked to some form of transit, from which they were driven off to somewhere unknown. This wasn't the only place this had happened, either. Countless individuals were removed and imprisoned in what had quickly become, for them and the ones who had signed the warrants, a purge."

Several major officials - and many lesser - are detained and walked to a vehicle, surrounded by camera men and reporters from several different news networks.\n\nThankfully, no reporter ever got in earshot of a rebel, and any dissenting opinions were talked over by guides. Nearly every (legitimate) media station in Iberia had someone at several arrests, and we were able to put on an impressive show of force as an example to any would-be traitors."

Forced to defend himself, against fabricated but numerous evidence, he was stuck in a losing case. Perhaps the most damning piece of evidence was the testimony of his coworker, who was able to corroborate many of the bureaucrat's conspiracies.\n\n\"I do not know-\"\n\n\"Do not lie to the court!\" snapped the judge. \"We have documents in our possession proving that he was an accomplice in all of your crimes!\"\n\n\"I sentence you, Enrique Velasquez, to spend the rest of your life in prison in order to atone for your mistakes.\"\n\nSuffice to say, Enrique would not be without company."

Firstly, we would like to apologize for the way we were forced to carry it out. However, you, the people, must understand that these steps, while harsh, were necessary to save the Union...\" It was perhaps one of the longest and most winding speeches yet, both Caudillos speaking the same words - as Franco was broadcast to Portugal, and Caetano was broadcast to Spain.\n\n\"...Finally these matters have been dealt with, and the security of Iberia is nearly assured.

Despite having the arms of a crowd of people taking to the streets, they also had a fight on their minds, and they easily found that fight against the Guardia Civil.

Without their aid, we would be nearly blind to the actions occurring in areas such as Catalonia. This by itself, however, is not their only use. These collaborators also form the backbone of our bureaucracy, not only supplying the state with information but processing it too. We should, of course, reward these men and women for their deeds in service of Iberia, but an issue of more uncertainty is the method we will go about making use of our collaborators.\n\nThese people have worked with the state for many years, and as traitors have long since been weeded out we will never have to doubt their loyalty. There is an issue, however - these people are mostly despised by the natives of their regions, and might have grown complacent in their positions. We could use a potential solution to this by recruiting new collaborators, whose fresh blood could transform their regions into something more productive. Of course, as with any new recruits their loyalty would be uncertain.\n\nWho are we going to work with?"

There are many important positions that have been not yet created or are currently unstaffed, and promoting our collaborators to these higher positions could carry great benefit.\n\nIt should be said that the conservative option is only to have a reasonable number at any time, only allowing the most trusted in sensitive positions. While this would guarantee loyalty, it may not provide us enough manpower to keep things functioning. Therefore, we could let more than just the most trusted individuals participate in higher echelons. While they could get more done, we would need to be more careful of their influence in the government, and what consequences could occur. How are we going to go about this?"

 IBR.5357.d:0 "Now, one of our most critical plans is beginning to unfold. Regional autonomy has to go, as for maximum effectiveness we must subjugate all of the peninsula to the will of the central government. Only total control will suffice, for anything less would allow them to slip the net. There is a hitch - not everyone in Iberia realizes this, and separatist terrorists would stop at nothing to turn this entire turn of events to their advantage through trickery and deception. Our objective is to make up for that.\n\nWe could play the political game, and use our agents to cut out slack in the regional bureaucracy. This way, we could prepare it for anything thrown at it, offsetting any terrorist gains with gains of our own. However, we could also use our collaborators to challenge the gains themselves, using propaganda to convince the populace that what we are doing is totally beneficial.\n\nThere's only the time for one, so we have to make a choice."

These are the keys to politics, and if you can master the tools of the trade then you can get nearly anything to go your way. Our collaborators are masters at the political game, and assigning them to fix the bureaucracy was a wonderful idea. Knowing how to navigate the cutthroat political scene has served them well, and using that experience they have sorted out many issues facing the regional administrations.\n\nThe system is much more efficient. While we didn't offset any potential terrorist gains, a large amount of time and effort that would have been spent wrangling with local politicians has been freed, allowing us to direct ourselves to more valuable efforts."

 IBR.5359.d:0 "When you are engaged in politics, you must be exceptionally careful - setting off the wrong man or buying the wrong official can carry consequences, sometimes ones severe enough to set back progress considerably. Ultimately the best way to progress is through experience, as nothing hones political ability like trial and error.\n\nOur new collaborators, fresh faces and new blood, lack any meaningful political ability. Against the cynical bureaucrats of the regional administration, these agents have been mangled by the political games and, between them, have frequently left humiliated or worse-off than when they began. As a result, the bureaucracy itself has suffered. Cliques have remained as they were, efficiency has not been increased, and even though this worked before we now strain under the weight of slack our system cannot afford to have."

 IBR.5360.t:0 "A Strong Propaganda Campaign"
 IBR.5360.d:0 "When it comes to an information campaign, quality will only get you so far. What matters more is the source of the information - namely, how it is viewed. If people don't trust an outlet, then they will take nothing of what it says as truth. However, we have had no such issues so far. Our new collaborators, new faces with believable stories, have been received far better than expected.\n\nThanks to their ability to really provoke a crowd, the new collaborators have seen stunning success in singing our praises. While some have noticed the cynical nature of the campaign, we are making headway towards shifting the perception of Iberia. It is truly remarkable how well the new recruits can bring regionalists to lower their torches, a feat which our old guard could never hope to replicate."

 IBR.5361.t:0 "Disappointing Propaganda Campaign"
 IBR.5361.d:0 "If you want propaganda to be of any use, you have to make sure the outlet is popular and trusted. This is most likely why the public didn't receive our campaign - they despise the sources of information as corrupt, useless, liars. It was more than likely a mistake to direct our collaborators to disperse propaganda.\n\nKnown thoroughly by the inhabitants of their given regions to be puppets, their hostility to the Union was directed towards the informants. Lacking credibility, their propaganda has failed to inspire nearly anyone who was not already supportive. We have gained nothing over the terrorists and have effectively just wasted our time."
 IBR.5361.a:0 "Well..."
 IBR.5362.t:0 "The End of Self Rule"
 IBR.5362.d:0 "Finally, our objective is bearing fruit. The law to bring regional autonomy to an end, nicknamed the Regional Law, is having its specifics negotiated now. While some of the other provisions may vary, the most important - the total subservience of regional administrations - is guaranteed to be included. The voting itself is ultimately a formality, but it is sure to pass with a strong majority.\n\nWhile the voting itself is secured, the whole area is on heightened security during the procedure. Hopefully nothing will go wrong, but if it does it would be disastrous. Not only external, but we need to be on heightened alert for any internal dissidence."

We cannot stand by while the Union attempts to slaughter its constituent peoples...\"\n\nA manifesto was released to the media, sent to the government, and leaked in several public areas. This manifesto, written by a cabal of officials who consider themselves \"democratic\", launches itself on a never-ending tirade about democratization and resistance - a pleasant fiction, but it is laughable to ever even believe such a thing would happen in Iberia.\n\nOf course such actions from officials is treason, but they have naively signed their names within the manifesto. Following other trends, they will probably be found at their posts."

 IBR.5364.d:0 "Recorded at the dead of night, cameras from all sorts of media stations accompany the Guardia Civil. Officers escort the crews to the doors, to force them open and run in; A couple of minutes later and they emerge, escorting various men in sleeping clothes out of their homes. To the cameramen, they explain: these are traitors to Iberia, charged with attempting to sabotage its unity through treasonous media. They have already been sentenced to death.\n\nWhile this was certainly a good show of force, it fails to be anything else. The outrageous move has alienated many we could have otherwise won over, and even the conservative elements - the ones who are seemingly always by our side - consider it a bridge too far."

There's not much else to focus on other than him, contained in an empty room.\n\n\"I was there when they drafted the new law, and as a representative I was able to add my say in. On my honor, this bill has been made with your best interests in mind- or at least, with due consideration to them.\"\n\nMany representatives are featured on separate broadcasts, with each region being treated to its native collaborators.

Riot gear, extra recruits, the department was prepared to take every step to preserve the region from nearly anything short of war. They readied to break riots, to be the rocks upon which threats to common decency were smashed against. Nearly every city in the country saw a similar build up...\n\nBut when the time came, nothing happened. There were a few protests, a few crowds of angry citizens that must have been less than a hundred each. Against forces prepared for many more, they were shattered. Nobody of note has objected, and with time it will all be but a memory to be forgotten. Not even Franco, who had hoped for a minimum of unrest, could have predicted how smoothly it proceeded.

 IBR.5367.t:0 "Backlash Actively Being Contained"
 IBR.5367.d:0 "The Union supplied the Guardia Civil generously. From extra recruits, to extra tear gas, to extra rifles. The government was preparing for a fight like nearly nothing it had seen before - the worst case prediction was the Battle of Barcelona, all over the minority regions of Iberia. When the Regional Law was being passed and broadcast over television and radio, the Guardia Civil swarmed the streets, hoping to preempt their opposition.\n\nThey did, to an extent. As predicted, many took to the streets - some rural, but most urban. It took several hours for the first riot to be snuffed, through the others carried on with such fierce separatism that the regional governments were pushed to the edge in dealing with them. The situation seems to have stabilized, thanks to the collaborators, who were able to stop the worst using their insight into their respective regions."
 IBR.5367.a:0 "好吧。"
 IBR.5368.t:0 "Backlash Growing Out of Control"
 IBR.5368.d:0 "Everyone knew the Regional Law would near-definitely raise nothing short of hell on Earth in the minority regions. It was for this reason the Union was so generous with supplies - everything the regions asked for in order to shore up the Guardia Civil, no matter the request, was given to them in abundance. Even more of what they asked for was granted, and some of what they didn't, such as Guardia Civil from regions who had no threat of separatism. The collaborators, trusted as they were, were put to work figuring out how best to stop dissenters. After all, nobody knew the regions quite like the informants, whose insights could place the Union one step ahead of its detractors.\n\nPerhaps there was sabotage, or maybe there simply weren't enough informants to work on intelligence. No matter the cause, the local Guardia Civil was victim to a shocking revelation, as they prepared to move to stop regionalist dissidents; They didn't have what they needed to work effectively. Depending so greatly on a relatively small number of collaborators, there just wasn't enough insight to get ahead of protests. As such, the Guardia has been on the defensive ever since the protests started, which had now turned into riots. It will take a long time to get rid of their stain."
 IBR.5368.a:0 "不太好……"
 IBR.5369.t:0 "Low Opposition to Regional Law"
 IBR.5369.d:0 "There remains one all-important matter beyond the in-the-moment rush of protests and riots: The lasting backlash. No matter how well you stamp a rally, it counts for nothing if you can't stop them after the fact. This is a very difficult affair, requiring the dedicated work of administration to keep ahead of the opposition - the only way to stop backlash and lasting opposition is to stop their growth before it can begin. Hence, the administrative importance of being able to outpace them.\n\nThankfully, it seems we have totally succeeded in that regard. Our administration is strong and nimble, with the lethal slack cut out before it was able to kill us. As well, we have enough skilled, trustworthy collaborators to keep it that way, as they all put their masterful abilities at the pointical game towards chasing out corruption and inefficiency. Any meaningful backlash has been snuffed out, but some has still slipped through the cracks."
 IBR.5369.a:0 "So they keep earning their positions, I see."
 IBR.5370.t:0 "Sizable Opposition to Regional Law"
 IBR.5370.d:0 "What matters much more than snuffing out protests is making sure they create no backlash. Here, the real art of silencing dissent shows herself. Containing a protest means nothing if it has left martyrs and an opposition willing to take up the cause the next chance they get. It takes a strong bureaucracy to handle the backlash - it is of critical importance they have the size and scale required to outpace the opposition, no matter how large is necessary, for it is a war of scale.\n\nThis war is one we appear to be losing. The bureaucracy is not large enough to keep up with what is demanded of it. The enemy is gaining pace, capable of sowing dissent and spreading its rebelliousness to previously uninvolved citizens. It is going to leave a legacy of opposition, which will take far longer than any single protest."
 IBR.5370.a:0 "I suppose it could be worse.."
 IBR.5371.t:0 "Great Opposition to Regional Law"
 IBR.5371.d:0 "If you cannot stop the following outrage, then there is no point to even trying to snuff out a protest. It is an art in its finest variants of execution, as backlash is snuffed out before it can even blossom, and martyrs are eliminated while any still spouting rebellion are silenced. There is a process - the bureaucracy must snuff out the backlash, in order for it to truly go away. To do this, the administrative capacity must be greater than what the dissidents can put out.\n\nIt is not. It is totally insufficient for the purpose we require it for. Dissident is growing nearly unchallenged, and with the way it is growing it will not matter how well we suppressed the initial reaction. We should not mention what has slipped through the cracks, but rather what has slipped through the holes. Our administration has totally failed us."

 IBR.5372.t:0 "Voting on Regional Law Bombed!"
 IBR.5372.d:0 "As the day carried on, the deputies assembled to vote on - and pass - the Regional Law that was going to take Iberia by storm. The Guardia Civil had been deployed en masse to the minority regions, as the Union was providing everything they needed in anticipation. With the new equipment came even more gear than requested, and officers from non-separatist regions - unquestionably loyal - to help use them. A storm had been prepared for in all places possible, including even the chamber of deputies. Three guards had been assigned to thoroughly search all non-representatives, so that nobody could sneak in a device designed to hurt the representatives during voting.\n\nThis made it all the more shocking when a bomb was detonated during voting. A remarkably high-yield explosive, as evidenced by the building being judged as \"unsound enough to warrant an evacuation\", though the chamber was not irreparably destroyed. Two of the three guards were killed, with the third remaining steadfast and performing the evacuation order.\n\nThis is an absolute disaster. Somehow a separatist organization has snuck in contraband, even through all of the security precautions. Though no councilmen were hurt, it is shocking that they still managed to sneak through the security precautions. More surprising, however, is that the perpetrator is still unknown - usually by now a group finds some way to claim responsibility for an attack, using it as a point of pride in their propaganda.\n\nNobody has taken responsibility."

His screams, bordering on ranting to the crowd, speak of freedom. He tells of his time near the council, and of how the Caudillos - without even sparing a glance - ordered them around, as nothing but a formality. He speaks of democracy, of how the country ought to be free. Once he has found himself enough support, he breaches the most sacrilegious topic yet: Independence. No country ought to exist under another that would eras-\n\nThe Guardia Civil arrived, swarming on the scene like angry hornets. Over a megaphone, an agent speaks of a crowd, and of how they ought to disperse before they are arrested, or worse. He was not nearly as effective at speaking, until the Guard brandished their weapons. Most had the sense to leave, while those that didn't found the agent's promises true.\n\nOf everyone we let in, many were terrorists. This is a total disaster - we let in far too many people, and we didn't have the capacity to totally vet them all. Some were separatists, and not all of them made gestures grand enough to get themselves arrested. To make matters worse, the Regional Law was passed after the bombing, which has been used as a very effective talking point against the regime."

The situation seemed the end of Iberia, just waiting for some seperatist to grow bold and strike it all down.\n\nThat was not so. It seems as if everyone who was out to protest has lost their steam, with most returning home and those remaining easily subdued and detained. As the crowds left the streets, the Guardia Civil was far more capable of stopping separatist plots, slowly dragging the nation back from the brink. Only a short while ago, a well-placed plot could have destroyed the country. Now, we are back in a situation where it will take more than a scheme to obliterate Iberia."

These riots are much more violent than any preceding them, as the protestors have struck back at the Guardia Civil in ways that nearly didn't happen before. Tear gas is being thrown back at the Guard, several groups are getting physical, using improvised weapons to attempt to compete with riot gear. Most worrying, however, is that the men sent in have been shot at, as rifles and pistols are being confirmed as being used against them.\n\nThe situation is primed to only get worse as time goes on, as separatist support seems to do nothing but grow. The Guardia Civil seem totally under equipped for the situation, and the prospect of large casualties dampening morale hasn't done anything to help them either."

After this event, and a skyrocketing attrition rate with the Guard, the decision was finally made to deploy the military to the regions in order to enforce law and order.\n\nThey haven't succeeded.\n\nThe military presence seems to have inflamed the separatists, and the riots have gotten so intense they likely cannot be contained anymore.

While this would normally be an object of no concern, recent events have brought to light the downsides of having such an excessive number of languages present in the country.\n\nIt is a matter of fact that attempting to run administrative procedures through several different languages will only end poorly, as important descriptions are lost in translation and unnecessary strain is placed on the system as it has to cope with translating to this and that and this dialect and that sublanguage, when the entire process could be a fraction of the difficulty by simply printing in two languages - Portuguese and Spanish.\n\nThis would have its drawbacks, however. We are still currently running the government on Galician, and suddenly shifting over may have consequences. Not to mention that the unrest generated by simply swapping formal languages may outweigh any gain we could create. For this reason we could make a few concessions as a transitory stance, but segments of the government may not approve."

From this anger, Iberia began to decay.\n\nSlowly, but surely, the situation degraded. Terror attacks grew more constant, shielded from retribution by a populace with nothing left to lose. Tensions between the government and the people grew, the perceived injustice too great to bear. Society is ripping itself apart, and it will only take one strong shock to send the entire country tumbling down."

While spokesmen say that the economy is recovering from the lows of the Crisis, the skyrocketing unemployment rate, and the astronomical price of gas shows that there will be more pain in store for Iberia. The price of oil is still stubbornly high, which will retard our efforts for economic growth and prosperity for a very long time to come. Economists are already speaking of slow growth, perhaps even a recession due to the government's failed plans and lacklustre initiative.

News of it quickly made its way up the large chain of bureaucracy that defined the Iberian government and landed right in the hands of the security apparatus of the AAS.\n\nElsewhere, similar messages had also begun to appear, whether graffiti, sloppily designed posters or other illicit publications. One thing was certain, a wildfire had been set, with opposition to the regime becoming visible on the streets and walls of Iberia.

Raising his hand to try to soften the din he went over the message he had to relay again, already gritting his teeth in anticipation of what was to follow.\n\nThe tragic death of the two youths who had vandalized the AAS Station in Bilbao only to be arrested immediately on the scene was a travesty. Local police had been due to transfer the delinquents into custody to await trial only to find both had died under mysterious circumstances while being detained by AAS agents. Without having the full consequences in consideration the transferring officers had contacted the family of the deceased soon after.

The pair stopped at the heavy door blocking the view of what sounded like a relatively large meeting room, larger than what you would expect to find under a regular storefront. Without further thought the undercover AAS agent let herself in.\n\nWith this extremely fortunate infiltration of a large anarchist CNT terrorist group the government security agency has been able to finally map out further plans of revolt and also gain insight into their high morale.

At the sight of this walking disaster the security man let his cover slip for just a brief instance, smirking with glee, only to resume his half bored normal state. His reports in recent weeks had been enlightening to the agency. The state of the CNT had been heavily affected by the news of the decisive defeat in Barcelona, recruitment was at an all time low and the situation within active cells was not much better.

Incessant shouts of 'long live the Republic' and 'remember the last union' erupted every few minutes to the great dismay of state press that had gathered along the cordoned off sides of the protest.\n\nThe Portuguese will not tolerate subordination in a union originally formed out of desperation. Franco's iron fist likely will neither help quell nor hinder their capacity of opposition. In fact it may even bring rise to something else entirely.

We therefore have to sort this situation with minimal press coverage and wider government interference.

With due diligence he had informed local authorities who quickly came to the scene to discover the group had been plotting an attack in the city center.

Finally the call was given and he watched them storm in, hearing the faint noises of panicked shouting mixed in with a few silenced shots over the radio and across the street. After 5 minutes the street went silent again.\n\nThe successful AAS raid on an earlier infiltrated CNT terrorist cell has brought great spoils, both in terms of information obtained after interrogation and material loot.

Yet now signs show an increase in leftist organisational and political activity, coalescing around the demand for an independent and socialist Portugal. The forces of the Portguese left seem to be abandoning their differences and uniting across ideological and party lines, something that the Spanish left was not able to do truly 20 years ago during the Spanish Civil War. A single name and banner has been appearing around the cities in the form of anti-Iberian posters and other propaganda: The FSLP, the Socialist Front of Portuguese Liberation.

Rooting out this dangerous disease is however proving to be less of a simple operation and rather a self perpetuating cycle of reciminiations and violence.\n\nSecurity agents in Asturias have uncovered a particularly bizarre phenomenon. It seems that the growth of armed separatist groups has not simply been a product of Iberia's tumultuous political situation, yet had been spurred on by the arrival of more and more illegal arms shipments at Asturian ports, divied up to support small local groups as well as those further across the nation. Interrogation of the smugglers has so far failed to reveal much more about the situation, though it seems increasingly obvious that outside forces are helping spur on the separatist radicalism inside our borders.

Even worse, he was slightly embarrassed by it all. Regardless, he was able to talk some way to something, with the generals conceding that something would be done to rein in corruption, but that the issue was nowhere near as bad.\n\nThe first thing the Caudillo did was order the particular bureaucrat - whose identity he had been informed of - executed. In hindsight, perhaps it wasn't a good idea to trust such quick findings. Total investigations take much longer, and that it was finished so quickly should have been a red flag.

The corrupt partnership programs would be adhering very strictly to this new policy, or else the generals in charge would be taking most of the punishment.

The leadership was certain they could find documents about what was wanted out of them, but it would take time.\n\nEventually they did present some evidence pointing us in another direction, as well as some testimony of their own. The Policía Armada and the Axencia had been nearly at war for a long time for resources, and so the former had decided to take budget from the latter.

Since there was nothing but gut feelings to conduct business on, it follows that there was no business that we could conduct without an innocent being affected.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems our culprits feel the same way. Since we had no arrangement to bind the culprits, they were allowed to run free. Much of the worst has continued unabated, and separatists have taken advantage.

 IBR.5700.t:0 "工人抗议关税"
 IBR.5700.d:0 "Today in Madrid, thousands of farmers have joined in protest on the streets outside of the Iberian Council chambers for a third straight day. The issue that joins these farmers in protest is a recent announcement by Caudillo Franco, detailing government plans to ease and lift tariffs on all economic sectors. The government states that the continual abolishment of tariffs will encourage the international market to engage with Iberia, and will spur international investment into the Iberian economy over the long term. The farmers, however, remain unconvinced.\n\nFurthermore, the farmers are not alone in their protest. Many employees from the manufacturing industries have also turned up to express their displeasure with the removal of tariffs, arguing that the influx of cheaper foreign imported goods will force Iberian industries to make layoffs, and might even entice local industries to emigrate. \"The Caudillos put my livelihood at risk. My family has for eight generations survived off our humble farm. But now, cheap, imported, tariff-free foods will soon flood the store shelves. How are we to compete when I can hardly sell my produce?\" questioned Reyes Gallego. He inherited his family farm just outside of Madrid two decades ago, but like many Iberian farmers in recent months, he has been struggling to make ends meet. With Iberian consumers likely to prefer the cheaper, imported goods in stores, many farmers such as Mr. Gallego question how they will remain afloat.\n\nThe Caudillos have yet to make any comment on the protests as liberalization measures continue to be passed. Government spokespersons have, however, stated that the Iberian administration remains enthusiastic about the economic opportunities that will be presented with increased liberalization."

 IBR.5701.t:0 "Mass Layoffs Cause Unrest"
 IBR.5701.d:0 "Demonstrations in cities across Iberia endure, as tens of thousands of unemployed workers take to the streets across Iberia. Following radical liberalization policies, favored by the Opus Dei and technocrats within the Iberian Council, many manufacturers have laid off their workers, citing an inability to compete with the influx of tariff-free foreign goods. As the demonstrations continue to grow in size as well as in intensity, violence has become inevitable. Last night in Barcelona, altercations between protesters and police escalated. Following several hours of clashes, the city of Barcelona reports that 7 police officers were injured as well 58 protestors, with one police officer currently in critical condition.\n\nAs unemployment continues to rise, many call for the repeal of free trade measures and the re-introduction of tariffs. Several industry leaders have criticized the Caudillos for what they call a \"brazen, radical, and irresponsible\" approach to economic liberalization. The Caudillos, however, show no indication at halting these efforts, as they continue to further the liberalization programs.\n\nAs a result of the continual demonstrations, the Opus Dei have released a brief public statement, which reads: \"The public may rest assured that any and all measures of economic liberalization which have been proposed and conducted within recent months have been carefully considered. Many methods currently being deployed within Iberia are tried and proven methods, in which we place our fullest confidence. The temporary setbacks currently experience are to be expected with a radical shift, but we assure the public that soon Iberia shall reap the benefits of a prosperous and free economy.\""

 IBR.5702.t:0 "Cause for Concern?"
 IBR.5702.d:0 "Economic reports from this quarter have begun to arrive, and the trends are concerning. While initially the heavy investment in the armaments industry spurred growth in both the mining and manufacturing sectors, this growth appears to be approaching a plateau. The initial surge in job creation in mining and manufacturing has nearly come to a complete halt, as generous government investment into the armament industry continues to rise.\n\nWhilst Caudillo Franco continues to praise the apparent economic improvement through his Falagnist policy of state control, arms production, and autarky, many analysts have since decried these policies as an economic disaster in the works. Franco fervently opposes the recent concern, however, as government investment in the armament-related sectors continues to rise.\n\nDespite troubling economic indicators, public confidence in the Iberian economy continues to rise, as unemployment continues to slowly drop. Many wonder; is there truly cause for concern?"
 IBR.5702.a:0 "Surely we shall only benefit from this in the end."
 IBR.5703.t:0 "Signs of Decline"
 IBR.5703.d:0 "Within recent weeks, the reception of Franco's economic policies has been less than positive. While the Iberian economy saw some initial success with the heavy autarky measures and investment in armament production and supporting industries, fortunes have been reversed. The economy has since taken a swift plunge. With a large production of armaments and no end buyer, industries have been forced to curtail production to avoid the accumulation of unsaleable armament stockpiles. With the curtailed production came layoffs. Thousands of factory employees found themselves without work in a matter of days, as well as thousands of those working in commercial transportation and mining, as the demand for raw material plummeted.\n\nMany of the unemployed have taken to the streets, protesting the economic policies implemented in recent times. Many of these protestors take aim directly at Franco himself, blaming the Caudillo for the fast declining economic situation. With each passing day, the protests grow in size, with the largest of the protests in Madrid reaching a reported peak of 20,000 participants. As production continues to plunge by the day, it is believed that these anti-Franco protests will only increase in size, as more and more Iberians are put out of work."

 IBR.5704.t:0 "Franco's Address"
 IBR.5704.d:0 "Caudillo Franco stands nearly alone in front of an agitated crowd. The crowd chants various slogans as a multitude of signs are hoisted above the heads of the crowd. Many of the signs read phrases such as \"End autarky now!\" and \"Kill the arms industry, not our jobs!\" Franco begins to speak, and the roaring and chanting of the crowd steadily dies down, as they await what the Caudillo's address.\n\n\"Countrymen, I know what gathers you all here today. Fear. Fear for your future. Fear for your present jobs. Fear of change. I speak to you today to dissuade those fears. As a nation we have made vast progress in every facet of our society. Great progress! Yet, no progress comes without struggle. This is what we see in our economy today. The comings of great progress. Yes, we must face small setbacks, as we do currently. I do regret that many have to bear the brunt of these setbacks. Yet, it is necessary. Do not be afraid, my fellow countrymen, for golden times lie ahead!\" as Franco concludes his speech, the crowd once again erupts into anti-Franco slogans and agitated chatter, much to Franco's dismay. Franco quickly exits the podium behind a well armed police escort and swiftly evacuates the scene of the protest.\n\nAs the economy continues to plunge into freefall, factories and supporting industries continue to lay off workers and outright close down. As hundreds of thousands now find themselves without work, many businesses in the commercial sector have now begun to face a steep decline. The hardships aren't limited to the cities, however. Many rural towns relying on local mining industries now find their men without work, as the economic squeeze is felt outside of the cities. Unrest grows as many of those out of work are unable to find new jobs, and find themselves compelled to join in protests against Franco's economic policies."

 IBR.5705.d:0 "Caudillo Salazar stands proudly on a podium on the steps of the legislative assembly in front of a sizeable crowd. The bright flashes and rapid clicks of journalists' cameras emanate from the crowd. All members of the assembly, be they economists, journalists, or simply admiring citizens, have gathered for the same reason. To witness Salazar's announcement upon the next round of economic reforms. Salazar stands confident as the congregation vibrates with a tangible approval.\n\n\"Ladies, gentlemen.\" Salazar began. \"We have seen some difficult times together. As a nation, we have struggled with disunity, and as well as with our economy. We have hardly been experiencing a golden age. However, I am proud to confidently say that after much effort, our situation truly looks to be improving. That being said, I am not a man to halt at minor improvements. No. I believe I would share the nations' approval in saying that we should stop no further than absolute success.\" With that remark, the crowd erupts into an approving cheer, as the flashes of the cameras endure. As the cheers die down, Salazar goes on at length to detail the next round of imminent economic action.\n\nWith the implementation of Salazar's economic policies now proceeding in full force, Iberia's economy has begun to make decisive improvements. With this comes the benefit of increased public approval for Salazar, as many attribute Salazar to the creation of new jobs and economic opportunities. While the reforms remain largely in the preliminary stages, the public approval indicators are remarkably favourable."

Industries both new and old continue to prosper, and the demand for employees is at a several decade high. As a result, unemployment continues to plummet. The newspapers praise the current economic success as an Iberian economic rebirth. And they all recognize one man, one catalyst for this national boom. Caudillo Salazar. Salazar's fervent and unending struggle to embrace the status quo and undertake responsible and careful economic management was nearly defeated at several turns, yet he did not falter. Not when opposed by the Spanish Caudillo, and not when the skeptics of the Falangists and Opus Dei pushed their agendas of radical reform.\n\nBut even Salazar did not foresee the economic upswing that Iberia now enjoys. While through the loan-fueled investment growth was confidently predicted, the current figures of economic growth far surpass any projections. As a further benefit, approval ratings of Caudillo Salazar, collected by various newspaper media outlets, show to be as high as seventy percent. Truly, nobody could have anticipated a better outcome."

Yet, now the land he once had known like the back of his hand, where he had once conducted extensive military exercises with his hardened veterans, has greatly changed. It had been over 20 years since his reconquista of Spain, enough time for the German instability and the new Iberian wedding to leave its toll. Franco considered that a proud showing in Morocco may prove his legitimacy and reign in any unruly colonial officials, but he had also always been a man of simple action, not a bombastic dictator like those two men who had helped him cross the narrow sea. Should he perhaps arrive quietly and get straight to business?"

The argument for this is simple: having a puppet state will allow the Iberians to better galvanize resources from the area, whether that be manpower, labor or natural resource extraction. Yet giving any form of concession to the Africans may be met with ridicule from European neighbours. Italy in particular could see this as a sign of weakness and could then push for a strengthened presence in the Mediterranean. However, the flustered Spanish strongman has to make a decision now, the men before him waiting eagerly for a response. Prestige or a decline in efficiency?"

Over the course of several hours, it became clear that the settlers were agitating for more subsidies from the Iberian government to lessen the burden on them. They agonised, in painstaking detail, the hardships the face in trying to settle the arid deserts of Morocco, from worthless and parched soil in the hinterlands to lack of any honest work in the cities. While it will place further strain on the Iberian economy, it may be advisable to promise them more financial support, even if it is just to keep them quiet and loyal.

The uniform of the Iberian army. How could he defeat his greatest fear, militarism as personified by his Spanish counterpart, if not by at least trying to shape into something less threatening if not possibly useful? However it spoke against his entire nature and persona he had so carefully crafted over the years. After all was he not the moderate to Franco's delusional grandeur? The question now is should he try to become more of an iron fisted dictator, at least for show, or stick with his usual statesman appearance?"

As the grand oak doors were opened to the stiff yet resolute Portuguese Caudillo all heads turned to inspect the new entrant. The accompanying soft murmur began to eat at the now very uncomfortable aging statesman as he began to make his way slowly to his seat. A quick scrutiny of the bitter looking faces of the men he was about to address told Salazar all he needed to know about how his gambit had transpired. None would speak out against him openly but his image had now been tarnished considerably."

For all his animosity towards Adolf Hitler he still admired his ability to mesmerize and work an audience. The seasoned Caudillo walked slowly towards the podium, all eyes in the room again on him, with the only sound heard coming courtesy of the din of the living city outside the steadfast walls of the palace. As he stepped up to the wooden rostrum he looked down briefly at the collection of notes he held in his hands. He was surprised to see them shake slightly. Age was beginning to get the worse of him. He quickly recovered again, placing both arms first across his chest while surveying the assembled men and then onto the podium itself. He had gained their fixation, and it was time to begin."

 IBR.6006.d:0 "The next topic was an uncomfortable one for him to address considering the room he was in. No matter how this would be played he would likely lose. He sighed to himself briefly, then began his tirade against the terrible terrorism that has swept the Union. How these so called freedom fighters dared to undermine the much needed stability of the Iberia, not caring in the slightest about the consequences on real people living their ordinary lives. Clearly these dastardly scum had to be expunged from the nation like the parasites they were. Yet how was this to be done effectively when most of them came from minority groups which currently still enjoyed the protection of the Union? The question of how to approach the next part of his speech was not an easy one for the old man. Should he push for a harsher policy towards minorities in order to safeguard national security, or take a more moderate approach, in the process likely losing a hefty amount of political power to his more hardline Spanish counterpart?"

Seemingly someone in the high command had committed absolute treachery by leaking his radical views on how to tackle the issue to the public. The poor display had managed to make its way around the country at a terrifying pace despite the best efforts of state censors. Considering the vast majority of the Iberia supported a tough stance on national security due to recent developments in global political affairs he possibly could still spin this to reduce damage to some extent. Yet the views of those minority groups he had talked so poorly of could now not be changed anymore, he had betrayed them for which his political career would bleed heavily."

 IBR.6008.d:0 "It was a crisp, clear morning in the Portuguese municipality of Ourém. The white marble running all around the Sanctuary of Fatima reflected the morning sun's brilliance, bathing the plaza in warmth and light. As usual, Salazar's modest motorcade arrived early, and the Caudillo of Portugal found himself with time to burn before his appointment with the Portuguese bishops. Waving off his bodyguards to permit them a cigarette break, Salazar squinted up at the gold-plated cross atop the spire of the central cathedral as he pondered how to go about his discussion with the bishops. It had been some time since he had dealt with the clergy directly, despite their major role in the Estado Novo. Would they be simple, honest men like the ordinary priests he had known growing up, or illustrious and regal figures representative of the Church's wealth and power? What approach would best speak to them, and win them over?"

 IBR.6009.t:0 "Muted Reactions to Personal Anecdotes"
 IBR.6009.d:0 "If Salazar was hoping to find some kind of personal connection in his story of how he ultimately DIDN'T become a priest, he was sorely mistaken. Clearly the bishops had no interest in hearing excerpts from his biography when there were serious matters to take care of. Gritting his teeth and kicking himself mentally by the end of the meeting, Salazar was several shades redder and looked a few years older as he marched back to the limousine afterwards, having gotten nothing out of the discussion besides an embarrassing anecdote about himself."
 IBR.6009.a:0 "Perhaps they were expecting a more substantive conversation."
 IBR.6010.t:0 "Bishops Warm Up to Salazar"
 IBR.6010.d:0 "\"I had no idea, Senhor Salazar.\" Bishop Anselmo had said, clearly impressed. \"To be so personally invested in the Church at such a young age was rare even amongst my own generation. Though you were surely called by God to your vocation, I feel the Church is diminished simply by its inability to count you amongst its servants.\" If that wasn't the sound of successfully charming his way into the confidence of some of the most influential men in Iberia, Salazar didn't know what was. Despite his age, the chauffeur noticed a confident energy in the Caudillo as he took his seat in the back of the limousine and opened up some light reading.\n\nThe bishops, too, parted ways with Salazar feeling decidedly more relaxed about dealing with the Caudillos in future. Franco had been so... coarse, despite his faith and good intentions. Their own quiet, charismatic countryman was far more agreeable and clearly a reliable brother in Christ. A cordial smile, it seemed, answered far more of their questions than a stack of government pamphlets."
 IBR.6010.a:0 "Salazar has clearly gained trust from the Church."
 IBR.6011.t:0 "Attempt to Bring Up Issues Fails"
 IBR.6011.d:0 "Even Salazar felt himself sweating a little under the collar as the bishops stared at him, stone-faced and dull-eyed. He couldn't tell whether they were annoyed or just plain bored. Whatever the answer, there was little in the way of mutual exchange, with the increasingly weary Caudillo mostly just talking \"at\" them rather than \"with\" them. The longest response to any of his statements had been \"Yes, Senhor Salazar.\"\n\nAfter the meeting, as he stood out in the hot sun dabbing at his creased forehead, Salazar found himself grousing out loud to his bodyguards about how obtuse and unhelpful he found these meetings with the clergy. \"I'd never get stonewalled by old Father Pedro!\" he exclaimed."
 IBR.6011.a:0 "Perhaps they think some bounds have been overstepped."
 IBR.6012.t:0 "Bishops Agree With Several of Salazar's Opinions"
 IBR.6012.d:0 "\"Which is, of course, why regional particularism is such an issue for us. Regardless of how the people feel about their own nations, we cannot risk a breakdown of the state, as happened to Spain during their civil war.\"\n\n\"Of course, Senhor Salazar,\" replied Bishop Manuel. He turned to his colleagues. \"We are in agreement then, brothers? No support for our regionalist friends?\" He was met by a round of nodding.\n\nSalazar smiled broadly, his shoulders finally relaxing. \"Then I believe that's everything for today, your eminences. If you'll excuse me, I am due to return to Madrid within the next few hours and must keep to schedule. My secretary here will answer any further questions you may have,\" he said, gesturing to the cheery-looking, dapper young man beside him. \"Until next time, my friends.\"\n\nScore one for statecraft. Get the right words out there, and men of the cloth are as pliable and easy to understand as any man in the street. Salazar could report back to Franco that their mutual understanding with the clergy remained as healthy as ever, and they would not have to worry about opposition from them anytime soon. Some consolation in a time of troubles, at least."
 IBR.6012.a:0 "A productive conversation, indeed."
 IBR.6013.t:0 "Choosing a Stage"
 IBR.6013.d:0 "In order to better address the economic situation in Iberia, the Caudillos have opted to host a discussion for business leaders in order to encourage cooperation with the government. Because of his talent for speech, and the predominantly Spanish makeup of the business leaders, Franco was the obvious choice for the job. Hosted at the Westin Palace hotel in Madrid, the function was primarily for business leaders, and brought to their attention specifically. Even though they are the main target, it is not yet too late to hold the speech in a public area.\n\nThere are two locations that are most easily secured for a summit, the main stage of Westin Palace or in a private undisclosed location. Hosting the speech somewhere more private will be an easier job to secure, as well as allowing for only the businessmen to be present. That way, they can be better catered to. The only threat there is of leaks. Alternatively, the speech could be made public, for a larger crowd. This will eliminate any risk of someone compromising secure conversations, and will prevent any unpleasant accusations about the loyalty of the Caudillo. It will cost more to secure the public location, and the speech will have to be broad in tone. Otherwise, some groups could be lost by catering to others. The obvious choice is to..."

 IBR.6014.t:0 "Choosing a Posture for the Speech"
 IBR.6014.d:0 "A location has been selected, announced, and set in stone. Franco would be speaking to a large audience, and marketing his ideas to the public, and not just businessmen. This is no time to forget who this is dedicated to, however- just because the speech is more public doesn't mean it isn't for businessmen first and foremost. To this end a new strategy must be devised. No speech is complete without posturing, and can be ruined with the improper application of it. It needs to be decided how the Caudillo will present his ideas to his audience, as to best ensure retention among the businessmen.\n\nThe first, and most obvious, tone is to take that of someone in favor of a free market. It is sure to win over many business owners, as the promise of an environment suited to them is one tantalizing enough that they are sure to be lured in. While this may anger some elements of the government, these can be mostly mitigated by taking a more conservative position on businesses. Alternatively, it has been proposed to take a tough stance on corporations, asserting authority over them. If there is anything they will respect, it is a leader that is willing to take executive authority. What form will the Caudillo's tone take?"
 IBR.6014.a:0 "A free market posture."
 IBR.6014.b:0 "A business friendly, but conservative posture."
 IBR.6014.c:0 "A strong, authoritarian posture."
 IBR.6015.t:0 "做出承诺？"
 IBR.6015.d:0 "More easily guarded, a private setting was the obvious choice to hold a speech at. Only the higher echelons of businessmen will be actively attending, amounting to a small group. This will make the situation much less formal, allowing for a few targeted incentives to be made. With the public not watching, making assurances becomes far easier, and much less risky.\n\nOnly, it is a conscious choice to make these assurances. If one were to promise to the business leaders that the Iberian economy would get just a touch more free, it could go a long way towards getting their attention. These reforms will nearly ensure their support, if the trouble is taken to address them. However, making what is essentially a bribe for political capital is frowned upon. If it were to be found publically, then it would create new issues. Therefore, the speech could be made vague and simply assuring the targets prosperity and growth. This will not make any particular friends, but on the other hand it would mean the speech would be mostly bulletproof politically. Is the risk worth the potential gain?"

The summit itself seemed to be winding down, and as it prepared to end and everyone to go home, something of interest occurred. A group of highly influential businessmen, introducing themselves by rank, have shuffled their way into Franco's notice. Introducing it by scraps and pieces, they construct an offer for the Caudillo.\n\nCorporate profits are fair, but they are not as fair as they could be. The Iberian government has the means to fix this error, and they may do so very easily. All it would take is recognition of the superiority of the companies in question. Since they are more powerful than the rest, then they ought to be better appreciated for what they do to the country. As it would happen, some of the resources Iberia would save by helping them could be used as reciprocation. It is an easy decision, they say. All that support, for just a little bit of favor..."

 IBR.6017.d:0 "Apparently, the deal was not as private as expected. Someone present at the meeting between the Caudillo and the council of businessmen took a recording, and has only leaked it a few days later. Anonymously shared, it is hard to tell if the guilty party was a traitorous guard or a man hiding a recorder in his suitcase. Who did it matters little now, as they cannot be readily found.\n\nWhen it was leaked, it was especially directed towards the press. Being the predatory vultures they are, they took the bait and published it sky-high. Now the information cannot be stopped, so the whole country is scrutinizing Franco for his seeming corruption. Most crucially are the intelligentsia, who feel betrayed that a leader would resort to such hypocritical means for little of actual value. The bureaucrats feel the same way as well, drifting more towards Salazar - who is seen as a far more upstanding example of a politician."

 IBR.6018.t:0 "The Genre"
 IBR.6018.d:0 "António de Oliveira Salazar has recently finished writing his first book after over thirty years of political experience, first at the head of the Estado Novo regime, and now as one of the Caudillos of Iberia. During this time he has surmounted many challenges, both political and personal in nature, and he has drawn on this wealth of experience in creating this masterpiece of Iberian literature. Painstakingly dictated to his secretary over the course of several months, the first draft is ready to be composed. Salazar however has yet to decide what to keep and what to cut from this unwieldy transcript, ever so diligently copied out and perfected by his assistants.\n\nTwo directions to take the book in have been suggested to him by his close associates, that of a manifesto of his own political beliefs, or an autobiography of his personal struggles during his life. Salazar himself has expressed that a political statement to guide the Iberian people would be an apt legacy for him to leave behind, but the idea of an inspiring personal epic appeals to him greatly as well. With the Caudillo remaining indecisive, and papers continuing to pile up on his desk, it may be pragmatic to convince him to make a final decision. What should it be?"
 IBR.6018.a:0 "A manifesto of Salazar's political philosophy."
 IBR.6018.b:0 "An autobiography detailing Salazar's personal struggles."
 IBR.6019.t:0 "The Content"
 IBR.6019.d:0 "With the genre of the Caudillo's new book having been decided upon, Salazar's secretary and his assistants have religiously prepared suitable extracts from the initial transcript over the course of a few weeks, every extract having been chosen for its particularly inspiring and powerful advice, vivid descriptions of Salazar's experiences or Salazar's enlightened political philosophy. Salazar has so far been delighted with the choices presented to him by his assistants, but has yet to decide on specifically what he wants in the book, whether it is to be a personal and heartfelt book, aimed at imparting Salazar's enthusiasm and advice to the reader in order to rouse the Iberian people to greater things, or to be a ceremonious and authoritative text containing Salazar's prescriptions for society, aimed at safeguarding the Iberian state, guiding the politicans of tomorrow and preserving the legacy he has painstakingly worked to build during his time in office.\n\nEither way, the Caudillo doesn't seem to be rushing to make a decision, and the book has taken up enough official time as is. Salazar should be encouraged to choose the passages he wants to include in his masterpiece post-haste, as not only do state papers lie on Salazar's desk unread, and urgent bureaucratic work left untouched, but the second Caudillo Francisco Franco himself is becoming concerned with Salazar's apparent idleness. A decision must be made."

 IBR.6020.t:0 "The Conclusion"
 IBR.6020.d:0 "Now that the Caudillo has decided on the specific contents of his book, he has one final decision to make before this paragon of Iberian literature can be sent to the printing presses. A conclusion has yet to be written, and Salazar is torn between concluding that it will be the educated elite that will guide Iberia towards a bright and proud future, or that it will be the common Iberian toiling away that will bring about a golden age for the Iberian people.\n\nWhile favouring the intelligentsia would most likely cement Salazar's book as his magnum opus and possibly increase the loyalty of the intellectuals to the Caudillo, concluding that the common people will determine the future of Iberia could help to foster wider support for the regime, as well as cynically generating a larger profit for the publisher and himself to pocket. Salazar however is more concerned with its popular reception than what a few jumped up toffs think, and while it will be a difficult and lengthy series of arguments needed to convince him of the political benefits of dedicating it to Iberian intellectuals, it may be expedient to make him see this point of view. Alternatively, letting Salazar have his way is surely the quicker route to publication, and more importantly, back to work for Salazar. What should he be convinced to conclude the book with?"
 IBR.6020.a:0 "A declaration that the educated will guide Iberia towards a great future."
 IBR.6020.b:0 "A declaration that the common Iberian will lead the way towards a great future."
 IBR.6021.t:0 "Intellectuals Impressed by Salazar's Manifesto"
 IBR.6021.d:0 "Salazar's political manifesto has been met with great acclaim within the intellectual community since being published, as the wise ruler expected it would be. His work received not only favourable reviews from Iberian literary groups and authors, but also internationally his book has also been received well, especially in neighbouring Italy, and to a lesser extent in America, with most copies having been bought by a minority of NPP members. The only frankly minor criticism voiced by the intellectuals is that it might be a little too high brow for the masses, but that doesn't seem to bother Salazar, who appears to be content with the other praise he has received.\n\nUniversally, his theories and guidance have been praised as comprehensive and well thought out, with the rhetoric and ideological dogma usually found in political literature to be mostly absent. Iberian scholars agree that it has a clear vision for society under Salazarian ideals, and some have even written to the Caudillo to express their support for the society envisaged in his book, an occurrence that greatly pleased him. There has yet to be a particularly critical or scathing review of Salazar's work, most likely because the ideas and content are simply indisputable of course, not that there are any other reasons for no one speaking up. Overall, Salazar is incredibly pleased with himself and the book he has worked tirelessly to create, and now he can finally focus on official work once more."
 IBR.6021.a:0 "Recognition from the Iberian intelligentsia is highly appreciated."
 IBR.6022.t:0 "Salazar's Book Gets Lackluster Response"
 IBR.6022.d:0 "Much to the dismay of Salazar, his book has been a complete flop both domestically and internationally! No intellectual of significance anywhere, let alone in Iberia has commented positively of his work, with it most commonly being described as \"confused, unfocused literary mess\" by the Iberian intelligentsia. Not only have intellectuals described the book as a muddled and tangled web of political ideas and personal experiences, but they have also said the ideas included are vague and difficult to digest and the experiences are particularly tedious affairs, and at some points painfully boring to read through according to one particularly scathing reviewer. The common Iberian has also found the book hard to engage, citing many similar criticisms that the intellectuals have expressed, though quite often in much coarser words. Francisco Franco of course has endorsed his fellow ruler's work, though it seems more out of professional courtesy than for its own merit.\n\nPoor sales and a bad reception make it unlikely for the publisher to agree to a second production run of the book, and Salazar is reportedly distraught to see the sale price of his work in shop windows be struck down lower and lower as the proprietors try to make at least some return on their purchased stock. For now it seems, Salazar's career as an author has come to an abrupt end, and the Caudillo has been left greatly disheartened and bitter by the whole affair."

 IBR.6023.t:0 "Salazar's Autobiography Takes Iberia by Storm"
 IBR.6023.d:0 "Only a week after being officially published, Salazar's new book has sold out. Demand for his inspirational personal epic has far outstripped supply, and a second production run is already being organised to cover the shortfall in copies. Reportedly, the personal perspective of the book and its inspiring life advice has found a receptive audience within the lower and middle class, and a newfound respect and sympathy for the premier has been fostered.\n\nNot only has the Caudillo's office been inundated with letters of praise from across Iberia, a whole series of spontaneous patriotic celebrations have broken out in Portugal. Street parties complete with overhead banners and fireworks have clogged Lisbon's streets for several days now, having quickly assembled after the last copy sold out in the city. The same phenomenon was repeated across several of the larger towns, and while some have suggested that this was not entirely natural, Salazar has dismissed these hearsay accusations and is content to bask in the popular acclaim being afforded to him.\n\nFellow Caudillo Franco also has apologized in private to Salazar over his misgivings about his publication, after acknowledging the increase in popular support for Salazar. The success of his work has far surpassed Salazar's own private expectations, and what he initially self-proclaimed as a masterpiece is now undoubtedly regarded as a cornerstone of Iberian literature by popular decree."

Some have already labelled this as a pointless and insulting PR move; something to put in the daily tabloids to distract from other more pressing news. Official statements, however, hail the proposed events as a turning point in Iberia's current political and economic fortunes, dismissing the criticism as pointless fearmongering.\n\nThe elderly dictator's first visit would be to the education ministry. In the run up to the day lobbyists have been arguing for more funding to increase Iberian standards of education both in order to help the national economy while providing better employment opportunities and to help the Union better compete on the global stage.

These dreams were foolish\n\nWith the passing of Francisco Franco, some mourn the loss of their savior, some rejoice at the death of a tyrant, some shed tears of regret at what could have been while others vow to maintain his legacy.

First a number of Portuguese politicians had secretly initiated talks on how to manage a peaceful secession from the Union. Seeing the writing on the wall with the way Franco dealt with the political crisis they knew the only successful future Portugal could forge in the future was one on their own. With their political considerations that Portugal would lose influence in the Union they increased the strength of the flame.\n\nSome documents from these meetings have however made their ways into the hands of Basque separatists who without having the full picture came to the joyous conclusion that an imminent armed struggle would ensue between the secessionist Portugal and the remnants of the Iberian government. For them it was hence the perfect time to finally stand up for their own freedom and independence. The next bit of fuel to the flame was added.\n\nAs the news was carried in the wind, between distorted and reshaped to fit the agendas of various other splinter groups, the flame finally had found its end destination.

This, in their eyes, was an opportune time to finally rid themselves of the hated Iberia yoke that had been oppressing them.\n\nNo matter the level of strict censorship applied to the national and local news, the populace nonetheless had felt the detrimental effects of decisions made at the top. Popular opinion, as much as it could be observed in these times of crisis, had switched from apathy into something far more sinister.

Day by day the newspapers were filled with headlines of leaders of capital and other economic figures taking their lives. The average citizen fared no better as even the spontaneously established black market began to run out of goods.\n\nProtest and economic standstill defined each city on the peninsula. As normal people began to turn their anger against the regime into action, a number of underground terror groups and freedom organizations saw their opportunity to finally push for the results they wanted.\n\nThe stability of the once so promising union had been undermined to a point where attempts from Madrid to rectify the situation were met either with harsh opposition or proven ineffectual.

While news of rioting and upheaval are coming in droves out of the region, Lisbon has entirely ceased communications with Madrid.\n\nThis however sadly was not the only concern. Other groups which had previously been hostile to the Iberian government have also taken this opportunity of crisis to break out in rebellion. Insurgents have been reported in a variety of Spanish cities. Their goal, unlike the Portuguese call for representation, was not entirely clear.\n\nIt was obvious to the Caudillo that Portugal would have to be suppressed on a large scale, but now even his own nation was wasting away around him. Traitors in his own ranks were making themselves visible. Previous Iberian loyalists who had seen their chance to change the system through working inside it had also lost hope when Franco had refused to cede ground to the opposition. Realizing that now the superstructure they had wanted could only be achieved through other means they as well have taken up arms against the new dictatorship.

On the other hand, the Portuguese team argues that this very reason, the disproportion of military industry, means Portugal should get more equipment than Spain, since Spain could quickly make up the difference once Iberia is no longer on the map.\n\nBoth teams have been arguing about this matter for days now and if the government wants to make sure Iberia is gone before the end of time, it seems like it must intervene and force a decision; since no team is willing to reach an agreement."

The Portuguese team, on the other side, says that once the Union is not united anymore, the Portuguese military will be much weaker than the Spanish one for a variety of reasons; and having the records from the academy at hand would help Portugal get up to speed with other countries.\n\nIt seems like this argument will take forever if it keeps its current pace, so the government will step in to make a decision for both teams, even if it's just to make sure Iberia doesn't exist for more than it needs to."

I have strong reason to believe that, with the death of one of the Caudillos, Iberia will shortly collapse.

Even in Spain's heartland, the sorrow for Portugal's finest son was genuine. None of the many groups that terrorized Iberia dared to make its move here, lest they invoke the remaining Caudillo's wrath.\n\n\"Mi General, we are going to exit Madrid's limits. We can return to El Prado now...\" Franco stared down at his personal orderly as to indicate any further insistence on the matter would get him re-assigned to the Western Sahara. Fearing the television cameras had caught the change in his facial expression, the horse-bound Caudillo turned his face to the sky.\n\nAs the funeral march crossed the Iberian internal border, the expressions of grief became more intense, entire towns went out to see the coffin of the man who had determined Portugal's destiny for forty-two years. Carmen had told Franco that riding on horseback for the 500 km would be inadvisable for a man of 75, but he did not care. Once they reached the late Caudillo's hometown of Vimieiro, Franco remembered reading about his appointment as finance minister at the last page of a newspaper in 1926, receiving his congratulations ten years after, fighting with him over Spanish intervention during war, negotiations over the Union, his mediation during the establishment of the Triumvirate. Franco's heart sunk in a way it had not since his youth. Now, however, was not the time for that. After his orderly was replaced by a Portuguese counterpart when they crossed the border, Franco was the only member of the Madrid procession left by the time he stepped off his horse to follow the coffin into the chapel."

He could feel his skin being burned by the intensity of the camera set-ups at the cathedral as he moved on to finish the speech.\n\n\"But most of all... \" The Caudillo sniffed ever so quietly, as the sentiments overwhelmed the carefully practiced emulation that he'd adopted, and his real, squeaky Galician voice took control.\n\n\"He was my friend.\"\n\nNo-one outside Iberia paid much attention to what he said, talk in the foreign media was all about speculating on what sort of ailment he was suffering from for him to be wearing his characteristic sunglasses indoors."

It's just funny to see you new agents so diligent about textbook shit.\"\n\nAfter a while longer on the road, the two men found themselves at their location. A man, printing newspapers out of his garage. Not only did he clearly engage in the act of unauthorized self-publishing, the newspapers were also in Catalan. They most certainly were printed as separatist agitation - even though neither Axencia operative could read the language, they were sure all the same.

The agents at the office would handle the case from now on using their evidence and testimony, but the process would be parallel to the traditional justice system.

As his partner wrestled the teacher onto the desk, handcuffed him, and struggled him out of the door, it fell on Guillermo to cover for the children.\n\n\"Ah...\" he looked at them, stepped towards the door, and gave them a small speech. \"Your teacher was a Basque separatist! That means he tried to destroy Iberia. Look out for anyone who does the same!\" His words were drowned out by the sounds of thrashing and screams from the hallway outside the classroom.\n\nAs they led the now bloodied and bruised man out of the building, Guillermo stumbled on a doorframe, falling down the steps of the entrance. \"What the hell? Pay attention to your surroundings, clumsiness could be the end of you some day!\" The junior operative, still in a daze, picked himself up and apologized.\n\nOn their way back to the station, Guillermo stared out the passenger seat of the AAS undercover car. The children. Their faces of horror watching someone they knew being removed by force. Their fear hearing the pounding and screams from the hallway. He had skimmed the teacher's profile before the mission, he was no violent criminal. He did not deserve this.\n\nBreaking the silence, his unfazed partner began to chuckle..."

But now, as the CNT once again faced off against Nationalist soldiers in the streets of Barcelona, he understood that that dream was dead. Perhaps, in another world, the Revolution could have succeeded. But not in this one.\n\nAdolfo opened his closet, removing a small pile of clothing to find a small latch on the bottom. He opened a secret cache, memories of decades long past. There was his 'Tigre' rifle, the weapon he had used in his first and only kill. A weapon he had imagined he would use many times again resisting Francoist domination after the fall of the republic, but never did. He moved the rifle slightly to reveal an old black-and-white photograph underneath it. There he was, on the left hand of the image. A few inches shorter than the other young men with him. His facial hair had not yet grown in. He was holding his rifle and smiling. With him were four comrades, all of whom he remembered well. Ramón, who could make anyone laugh even at the worst of times. Shot by a sniper in January of 1939. Manuel, a brilliant student and equally brilliant fighter. Told Adolfo he was running away to France and was never heard from again. Sara, the girl with glasses that he could not help but imagine one day marrying. Captured by the Francoist regime shortly after the war, and never seen again.

While they may be able soldiers, their brutality, and treatment of those unlucky to fall enough into captivity is something that I will never be able to forget.\n\nI look forward to the day when I can leave this blasted desert. Our unit is supposed to be rotated out within six weeks at most, hopefully in time for our anniversary. We will be on the offensive soon and I will not be able to write to you for some time.

Saturnino tried to relax, there was little risk of attack while in Oran, where his squadron was well under the protection of coastal batteries.\n\nThe captain eyed the Portuguese landing ship two hundred meters to his right with increasing anxiety, hoping that it would deliver the last batch of tanks to the expeditionary brigade so he could get on his way back to Gibraltar. Ironically, he thought, the LCPL was a former Italian ship - one could tell by the design. That idiot Salazar bought it second hand, and the seaman was sure the Caudillo had paid more than it was really worth. Nevertheless, it got the job done, and the last Ibíce was rolling out its cargo hold and into the dock within thirty minutes, albeit in reverse. Saturnino, satisfied with his job, gave the order to leave the port...\n\n\"Mi Capitán!\" The anxious engineer's screech couldn't mean anything good, he could feel it in his bones. \"We... thought it was an error, but the Cervero has picked up the same signal.\" Looking at the radar screen from afar, Saturnino spotted the approaching blips. \"Shit.\" For a second, he was paralyzed, but his aristocratic officer instincts got the better of him."

Remember, hit the landing ships, don't waste your bombs on... shit.\" It was already too late, Martionetti and Frigerio were on a vector straight towards the Canarias, and their FIATs sped right past Lombardi's. Unsurprisingly, he could not reach them by radio. \"Technical difficulties, my ass.\" Once they return from the raid he would get them court-martialled, their insubordination could cost the entire operation.\n\nStruggling to keep his composure, Captain Saturnino was fixated on the black puffs that perpetually missed their targets, if ever so slightly. By now, the 203mms had been aimed, but the plane's approach was too difficult to... two of them were breaking off. The captain threw himself at the cruiser's intercom, virtually stapling his hand to the \"talk\" button while holding his binoculars with the other. \"Gunnery Officer Perez... RANGED SHOT AT 200 METERS steady... ELEVATION 36°... steady.\" He could spot the muzzle flashes from the Italian's 20mm cannons, and soon, the ship's hull was taking their lead. It was inaccurate at that range, but it might make a lesser captain keep his head down. No, not him, not a de la Hidalga. \"NOW.\" The main battery went off in a heap of powder.\n\n\"FRIGERIO YOU FUCKING IMBECILE.\" Lombardi cried in desperation as the airman's left wing was destroyed by shrapnel from the Canarias.

One choked a sob as a rocking chair swayed him back and forth.\n\nThe other lit a cigar. Tiny embers and speckles of ash struck out against the blue glow of breaking news cascading from La 1's high rise offices in Madrid.

We were unprepared for this week's attack. Our intelligence community failed to recognize the scale of the planned operations, and our police and military were not ready to make a decisive and immediate response. We cannot allow any attack like this to happen again.\n\nWe have long known that a small underground CNT resistance persisted ever since the liberation of Catalonia 25 years ago. This morning the Iberian Intelligence Center prepared a detailed report on documented acts of homicide, assault, and arson linked to the CNT, showing that in the past seven years CNT violence has been increasing yearly. The failure of our government to recognize and react to the rise of this terrorist activity is damning. It should not have taken a tragedy as severe as Barcelona to formulate a response.\n\nIn addition to their comprehensive review of CNT activities since the Union's formation, the Intelligence Center has identified several extremist organizations which have escalated their activity, emboldened by the CNT's actions in Barcelona. Already last evening, a security officer was attacked in Bilbao by a 23-year-old extremist Jimeno Inchausti. In his interrogation, Inchausti admitted that he had not worked alone, but was part of a network of Basque-separatists calling themselves 'Euskadi Ta Askatasuna'. Between 1950 and 1963, only 15 murders could be linked to extremist groups besides the CNT. However, in just this past month, no fewer than 7 such acts of violence have taken place--4 in Navarra, 2 in Portugal, and 1 in Asturias.\n\nIt is all but certain that these terrorist groups will expand their resources and intensify their activities in the coming months. Increased funding and supplies will need to be provided to our military and intelligence services to identify and eliminate these groups.

Ending his speech with a minute of silence, the Caudillo bowed his head and tightly gripped the podium, his brows revealing suppressed anger.\n\n\"We will destroy the terrorists.\"\n\nThe Council erupted into applause, and Franco left the stage. Valcárcel stepped up to the podium. His speech began much as Franco's had, solemn and austere, but soon shifted his focus to matters of government policy. \"Councilors, we are engaged in a struggle for the very spirit of Iberia. For the Union to survive, your service is urgently needed. Caudillo Franco and Caudillo Salazar have ordered new legislation to provide the Axencia Anti-Separatista the power and resources necessary to fully eliminate the leftist threat. Iberia cannot afford a government divided by factionalism or language, by politics or geography. Her Council must stand united against terrorism!\"\n\nEven as they applauded, many councilors were deeply nervous. Never in the history of Iberia had so many people been tasked with as important a task to complete in such a short timeframe. Murmurs filled the Palace after Valcárcel's speech. Most councilors did not know more than two dozen other people in the chamber. Who among them would write the legislation, and how could it be debated without sending the whole Council into chaos?"

Such were the measures that now had to be taken as the terrorist threat escalated.\n\nWith so few men on the council, it would be obvious if anyone were missing, and even more obvious if an unfamiliar face were to appear. And so, as Manuel Fraga entered the chamber for his first session, he could feel dozens of curious and suspicious eyes moving over him. Franco rose from his seat and began to speak. \"Gentlemen, I am pleased to welcome Señor Manuel Fraga into the Council. After much deliberation, Salazar and I have appointed him to head the newly established Ministry of Information. In this role, Fraga will lead a remewed, more organized effort to combat extremist propaganda. Several smaller bureaus in the present Ministry of Education, Ministry of Labor, and Ministry will be reorganized under Fraga's supervision, to ensure a consistent, hard-hitting effort against propagandists across the nation. I give the floor to Don Fraga.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my Caudillo,\" began Fraga, \"Good evening, gentlemen. As we attempt to bring an end to terrorism in Iberia, the terrorists have adapted new tactics, and new strategies to win over those vulnerable to their messages. In Girona last week, a group of CNT members briefly hijacked the city's largest radio station, preaching absurd anti-government conspiracies to thousands of people. Our battle against terrorism is just as much a battle against propaganda, and if we are to succeed in our mission we need to organize and expand our own media outreach efforts. The terrorists' propaganda is specifically designed to inflame regional tensions, and speak primarily to disaffected young men.\"\n\n\"If we are to succeed against terrorism, we need to target their recruiting grounds. The new Ministry of Information will devote the majority of its efforts to the regions and cities where terrorists are most active, with media messaging focused on reminding people of the great things the Caudillos have done for them, instilling fear in anyone who would think to oppose our security forces, and removing the 'mystique' of terrorist groups, turning them from subjects of fear and fascination into subjects of disgust and mockery.\""

 IBR.3119.d:0 "When he was a professor at the University of Duesto, Cecilio Mariñelarena never would have imagined himself having a political career. As the only Basque economist on the Iberian Council, Mariñelarena had frequently involved himself in discussions regarding the growth of terrorist activity in the region. He held the controversial belief that, though the Basque Country overall was among the wealthiest regions in Iberia, the rapid economic changes in the past decade were nonetheless significant factors in the growth of separatist extremism. As Valcárcel concluded his introductory remarks, he listened carefully to hear the full details of the bill Manuel Fraga, newly appointed Minister of Information, was about to introduce.\n\n\"Gentlemen, I am pleased to report that in just this past week, the Axencia Anti-Separatista uncovered and destroyed a large ETA weapons cache near Vitoria, and arrested 12 terrorist plotters in Tarragona.\" Fraga paused while his audience cheered. \"Though the seizure of weapons and arrest of conspirators are vital to the Union's security and these recent victories are significant, our media efforts are just as critical. A cache of ten thousand guns means nothing without as many terrorists to hold them, which is why I am putting forth a bill to increase funding to the AAS Information Office by 50%, to enable the AAS to purchase radio and television ad-space at greatly a reduced price, and to initiate a thorough review of the history textbooks used in secondary and tertiary schools to identify and remove separatist-sympathetic content.\" Even before Fraga gave the specific details of this bill, the loud applause made it obvious to everyone in the chamber that it would pass overwhelmingly. In the end, only five councilors of the 480 present voted Nay: All hardline conservatives objecting to what they perceived as a 'soft' and useless method to combat terrorism.\n\nMariñelarena joined the applause, and voted in favor of the bill. But though he both publicly and privately supported the bill's aims, he was frustrated. He already had to worry about paranoid conservatives suspecting that he was sympathetic to the separatists on account of his origin. There was only so much he could feel comfortable suggesting that Iberia's economic policy contributed to radicalization."

Information Minister Manuel Fraga stood at his left, and respected Law Professor and councilor Torcuato Fernández-Miranda stood at his right. Strangers before the council's formation, these three men had become increasingly close in the past few months. Occasionally the three were spotted at a cafe together, and often they supported the same initiatives in the Council. Tonight, though, was the most blatant showing of their informal alliance. Ullastres began a speech which had been co-written by himself and the other two councilors.\n\n\"In recent months, the efforts taken by our Caudillos, the military, police, and intelligence to combat terrorism have successfully crushed numerous plots. Nonetheless, public support for the regime has faltered in the face of disappointing economic growth, in addition to the lingering fear of terrorism and crime. If we are to maintain the goodwill of the Iberian people, it is vital that in addition to our expansions to the security apparatus, we expand our domestic institutions.\n\nThe small-scale poverty relief programs in the Iberian Union result in most of the unemployed suffering from poor living conditions, and in a handful of the poorest communities malnutrition continues to stain our Union. We are here today to introduce for discussion a detailed plan to combat poverty and expand public support for the government, while continuing to protect the status of the firms that form the backbone of the Iberian economy.\"\n\nOver the next several hours, the council discussed and at times debated over the viability of the new plans. While broad support could be reached for a few programs, particularly the proposed reforms to Seguridad Social, others proved highly controversial. At one point, an argument between Manuel Fraga and Rafael Duque became so heated that Franco himself intervened to bring the council back to order.\n\nIt is overwhelmingly likely that the next few months will see significant changes to Iberia's domestic policy, but exactly which changes will be made and which will be rejected remains unclear. In any case, after today's discussion nobody can deny either the existence or the significance of the collaboration between Ullastres, Fraga, and Fernández-Miranda, increasingly referred to by other councilors as..."

 IBR.3121.d:0 "It is hard to imagine the Battle of Barcelona coming at a less convenient time, if it makes sense to say that there is a \"convenient time\" for such a tragedy at all. The Iberian Council was still young, its members inexperienced, and the powers and limitations of the new legislature not entirely clear. Nonetheless, the Council prevailed through its first crisis, quickly drafting and passing legislation to better combat terrorists wherever they were to be found.\n\nThe Iberian Council has been tested, and it has passed its test. Few still doubt that the new legislature could solve at least some of the problems facing the Union. Perhaps, then, it is no surprise that mere weeks after Barcelona several members of the Council's reformist faction have launched initiatives to overhaul various elements of the Iberian legal system and government policy.\n\nThe \"Ullastres Plan\" and \"Fernández-Miranda Plan\", as they are informally known, have gained significant traction within the Legislature. Both plans are several hundred pages long, composed by dozens of authors, and advocate radical transformations to Iberian law and fiscal policy. The \"Ullastres Plan\" focuses on centralizing the government, rationalizing the administrative structure, and eliminating corruption, while the \"Fernández-Miranda Plan\" is focused on expanding social welfare, clarifying the definition and rights given to citizens, thereby ensuring the loyalty of the Iberian people.\n\nThe reform faction is all but unanimous in their support for both plans, and though no hard numbers are available, it is thought that somewhere between 30% and 40% of conservatives generally favor the plans as well. They have the backing of both Caudillos, and Manuel Fraga, a man respected by the Council's reformists and conservatives, has emerged as a loud advocate for the programs. With such a broad coalition of support, there is no question that these plans represent the future of Iberian governance. However, the current plans are rough drafts sorely lacking in specifics, and seeing them transformed into actual policy will take months if not years of effort."

 IBR.3122.d:0 "Alberto Ullastres knew that his proposals for economic reform had little chance of being approved by the council. His plan, a plan for rapid economic liberalization and development was as bold as it was controversial. Salazar had been the architect of Iberian economic policy ever since the establishment of the Union; he would surely not reject his own ideas in favor of a radical change of course. But perhaps, Ullastres thought, Franco would be a little more receptive. If there was one thing Ullastres had learned in his years in government, it was that Francisco Franco was not fond of lectures. Their lunch meeting was one of fraternity just as much as one of politicking. But light gossip was not why Ullastres was there. \"Caudillo Franco, you could be the face of Iberia's greatest economic boom. Economic growth has been slow, and the rest of Europe has gone to hell. What better time could there be to remind the Iberian people the kind of leader you are?\"\n\nFranco already knew of the plan, at least in its broader strokes. \"Alberto, we both know it isn't my ideas you'd be putting my face on.\" The Caudillo paused for a moment. \"I'll think about it, Don Ullastres.\"\n\nUllastres left the meeting feeling somewhat disappointed. But when the council assembled a few days later, he was stunned. Franco gave a lengthy, passionate speech advocating the reform plan. Perhaps it was vainglory, perhaps a need to show himself as superior to Salazar. Perhaps a genuine change of heart, or perhaps part of a wider strategy. Both technocrat and anti-technocrat alike were surprised to hear what they now heard, but the Spanish Caudillo's words swayed many in the middle. The planned changes would be the largest that the Iberian Union had seen in its history."

The literate classes of Spain ought to be aware that their King had deliberately caused the recent recession, debasing the currency with disastrous consequences in order to enrich himself and his allies. The very tools the political elite deemed necessary to preserve the Spanish Empire were instead bringing only destitution and corruption.\n\nAlberto Ullastres could not help but imagine de Mariana smiling down on him as he organized his notes. Since the heady days of life as a university student, it had been his life's goal to see his country's economy liberalized. It is why he taught political economy at his alma mater before he became an advisor to the Caudillos. It is why he encouraged fellow Opus Dei members to involve themselves in politics. And it is why he had done so much to convince Franco that he should be made Minister of Trade.\n\nThe battle over the future of Iberia's economy had been a protracted one, and the victory of the technocrats was by no means a foregone conclusion even just a few weeks ago. But with the backing of Franco and much of the Iberian intelligentsia, the technocrats undertook intensive lobbying efforts to persuade moderate councilors over to the reformist side. Despite considerable opposition, when the council was called to a vote, the 'National Economic Stabilisation Plan' passed 280-217. Ullastres was overjoyed, and took to the podium with great confidence.\n\n\"Fellow Councilors! Today, we have placed Iberia on a path to great prosperity. Today we join those nations which, by virtue of free trade and competent governance, have afforded their citizens with the longest and healthiest lives, with the longest and most thorough education and the most productive workforces in all the world. We will work to ensure that our government operates with the greatest efficiency, that it may best serve the state and its people. Our industry will be both modernized and expanded to remain competitive in an ever-developing world, and our rural communities provided the resources they need both to feed our rising population, and live just as well as their urban countrymen.

Nobody could honestly say that they were surprised at the outcome of the council's recent economic discussions, even if some of the more radical councilors found it terribly disappointing. Everyone, from the most ambitious reformist to the most ardent conservative could support efforts to modernize agricultural equipment. Everyone could support measures to ensure that lberia's weapons manufacturing be expanded to better deal with terrorism. Everyone could support modest decreases in business taxes to ensure continued growth.\n\nSalazar was always confident in his economic program and steered the Portuguese councilors to unanimously support what was essentially the continuation of the last decade's agenda. Most Spanish advisors agreed, and the sort of debate over economic policy Salazar feared may happen did not manifest.\n\nThe new economic legislation passed by the Caudillos today is not headline news. Its provisions are in line with previous policies. Its changes to taxation affect only a small percentage of Iberians. It does not call for sweeping changes in government expenditures. It is, however, hard to dispute that its changes will be of benefit to the Iberian nation.

 IBR.3125.d:0 "Last year the Council's discussions had been dominated by efforts to reshape the Iberian Constitution. With the support of all but a few dozen hardline conservatives, these measures were largely uncontroversial. The same could not be said of the recent economic discussions. For months, reformists and conservatives had argued over the direction of the Iberian economy. With the failure of both the Opus Dei and the Falange to win the hearts and minds of the Council, the future of the Iberian economy has fallen to the Council's moderates, supported by Caudillo Salazar.\n\nThe Caudillos recently returned from a secretive business summit in the Algarve, the transcripts of their discussions not having been made public. From what information the press could discern, after hours of discussion with Iberia's most influential and powerful businessmen, the Caudillos have agreed to a moderate reform plan balancing the needs of various sectors. Most changes are aimed at expanding and continuing to protect Iberia's heavy industry, while gradually liberalizing most other sectors of the economy.\n\nToday, Caudillo Salazar stands before the podium and delivers a speech before the Council. \"Friends, councilors, and citizens of Iberia: In the past fifteen years our Union has given its people an unprecedented standard of living, far healthier, happier, and wealthier than anyone could have imagined. Still, there is much work that remains to be done. I recently toured the northeastern areas of Portugal where I grew up. There I saw wheat fields, dry after only a few rainless days due to poor irrigation. I visited a once bountiful fig orchard which had been ruined by a beetle infestation. I visited a vineyard which had truly marvelous wine, but its grapes were smaller and fewer in number than those from Italian or French wineries. The problems facing Iberian agriculture speak to the problems affecting the economy as a whole. Though our economy is stable, growing, and among the largest in Europe, we have the potential to achieve even greater success. I stand before the Council today to announce Iberia's path forward, a path which will meet the needs of all Iberian industries as we march towards 1970. New government policies will be used to expand vital industry and promote trade both domestic and international. The tax code will be streamlined and rationalized, and emerging opportunities brought about by new technology will be explored.\""

In this most recent battle, one of words and minds rather than guns and planes, he expected no different. Franco had long been a supporter of autarky, and with the Spanish Caudillo's great influence Grandes and other Falangists could weave their way back into the highest echelons of political power. Franco gave his support, and so did the wealthy industrialists set to benefit most from autarky. Following prolonged discussions, Franco and Salazar announced they would sign a new economic plan drafted by the Falange with only minor modifications.\n\nAlberto Ullastres made an attempt to delay the proceedings. \"Our economy is nearly stagnant! Corruption and trade restrictions are strangling our ability to grow and to compete with our rivals. We cannot enact a reform package so gigantic the day it is released! Caudillo Franco, we need further time to conduct a full review of how this plan will impact investment, manufacturing, and poverty rates.\" His voice was shaking, his desperation obvious to all in the room.\n\nGrandes interrupted, \"Was it not the Falange that had predicted that the Spanish Republic would suppress its right-wing critics? Was it not the Falange that had saved the Spanish nation from liberalism, communism, and anarchism? Was it not the Falange that kept Iberia free from German or Italian domination? And was it not the Falange who highlighted the threat posed by regional separatists? So tell me, Don Ullastres, why do you believe that the Falange ought not be in charge of economic policy?\"\n\nUllastres was at a loss for words. Was Grandes trying to push forward a plan without even giving the Caudillos the time to read it in full? Maybe the Caudillos had read it, but if so why was the council not consulted until today?\n\nSalazar signed his name onto the proposal. The reform-minded councilors had suffered a great defeat.

When the council was established, Franco had offered Piñar a seat, and he accepted in spite of his opposition to the legislature's very existence. The Triumvirate had fallen apart, an inevitability in his eyes. Meager attempts at liberalization in previous years had failed to grow the economy as promised, and done everything to enable terrorists.\n\nAs the attention of the Council turned away from Constitutional matters, a war of words broke out between Reformists and Conservatives on the direction of the Iberian economy. The push by Piñar and his allies for a return to Falangist economics garnered considerable praise and voracious opposition both in the public and in the Council. Those calling for a gradual, moderate approach to economic policy reform quickly found themselves forced into either Reformist or Conservative camps. With Franco's heightened influence and endorsement of the Falangist plan, the hardliners of the council led by Piñar were reinvigorated.\n\nBlas Piñar's ideological struggle was one waged with backroom meetings and quiet bank transfers just as much as any noisy speech before the Council, but it was the vote today that would prove either his final victory or ultimate defeat.

He would be lying to himself if he claimed to have never imagined being Caudillo one day. Through the 1950s he had been among the most prominent politicians in Salazar's circle, and his inclusion in the Iberian Council was obvious. There he had made close personal connections to a variety of Spanish leaders, men like Manuel Fraga and even Caudillo Franco himself.\n\nAlong with Alberto Ullastres, he spearheaded the reforms to Seguridad Social that passed a few years ago, and he now hoped to work on other gradual reforms to Iberian policy. In the weeks leading to his appointment, he had his doubts whether Franco would select him, but trusted that his political connections and close friendship with the late Portuguese Caudillo would boost his chances.\n\nYesterday, Caetano was inaugurated as Portugal's new Caudillo. Today he would meet with the Council as Caudillo for the first time. It felt surreal walking into the same chamber as every other meeting, and taking a seat at the front of the chamber rather than his usual seat with the Portuguese ministers. The empty seat between Inocêncio Galvão Teles and Alberto Franco Nogueira spoke to just how much the situation had changed in so short a time.\n\nValcárcel called the council to order, and introduced Caetano to a council already well acquainted with him. Cheers, some more enthusiastic than others, echoed through the chamber. Even at this meeting, a meeting ostensibly dedicated to his inauguration, Franco spoke substantially more than Caetano, and Caetano substantially less than Salazar had at most prior meetings. This fact was not lost on anybody. On a day that Marcelo Caetano had hoped to showcase his willpower and capability, he instead appeared as little more than a lapdog for the Spanish Caudillo.

At the beginning of Salazar's tenure, fewer than 1 in 3 Portuguese children could read. Most elderly lived in destitution. One in seven infants would not live to see their first birthday. But under his wise and benevolent guidance, on the eve of the Iberian Union's founding, 3 in 4 children could read, all elderly citizens were provided pensions, and infant mortality had been cut in half. His bold initiatives as Caudillo of Iberia saw great reduction in poverty, have ensured that every single child is taught to read, and cut infant mortality in half once more. No man goes hungry in the streets. No child is denied their right to an education. Iberians live 10 years longer on average than they did a single generation ago.\n\nToday, our nation is left watching the ships, as we mourn the passing of one of the greatest leaders in living memory.

But that was hardly the case today. Even if Caetano was of comparable height to his predecessor, he hardly lacked the experience or even the dignity. To even a casual observer, Franco appeared the leader, and Caetano appeared as little more than his meek servant. Following the Caudillos were 20 armed guards, a disturbing sight never before seen in the halls of the Palace.\n\n\"Gentlemen!\" Franco yelled, still a few steps away from the microphone. \"The past few years have been marked by nothing if not conspiracy. Whether it was the CNT conspiring to occupy Barcelona or the ETA conspiring to rise up in Bilbao. Whether it was liberals trying to infiltrate our colleges or socialists trying to infiltrate our factories. Whether it was street partisans trying to destroy our government from without...\n...or councilors trying to destroy it from within.\nThe council failed to warn our intelligence services that anything was amiss in Catalonia, and soon Barcelona burst into flame.

Hell, it would have been dramatic news had Valcárcel announced democracy was an aspirational goal to slowly build over the next decade, but within months? He, along with hundreds of other people sitting in the Cortes, found it all hard to believe.\n\nIn the rest of his speech, Valcárcel outlined Iberia's need for a democratic transition, how its elections were to be organized, and the transitionary role of the Caudillos in this new system. Manuel Fraga did not really pay attention, still too stunned by the news. But ever so slowly, the world started to make sense again, and slowly Fraga became more and more excited.

After centuries of kings and queens and many decades of dictatorship, Spain and Portugal would be truly free.\n\n\"Torcuato!

He had spoken with the Caudillos on numerous occasions, urging political reform as a necessary step to truly eliminate corruption and ensure a stable Iberian Union. Now he had succeeded, not with violent revolution or a destabilizing coup, but through peaceful reform. No longer would the masses cry out with rage for want of a voice in government.

 IBR.3133.d:0 "It was an unexpectedly cold evening in Madrid. Not only for the clouds looming above and the sun setting beneath the hills, but in the deafening silence of several reformists as they sat together in a small cafe. They had failed. Years of efforts to save Iberia, save its economy and save its people from destruction, had all been for nought. Iberian democracy was stillborn, and its parents mourned their horrible loss.\n\nNeither Manuel Fraga nor Alberto Ullastres could deny that the dream of a politically and economically liberal Iberia was dead. Fraga's feelings on the matter were complicated, to say the least. He had always seen himself as a pragmatic conservative more than an idealistic reformer. The state may not be free, but there are always improvements to be made.\n\nUllastres had always been an advocate for the rights of the Iberian people to healthy, happy, and well-educated lives. Democracy was supposed to be the vessel to bring real change to Iberia. Without it, the masses could hardly hope to protect themselves from the regime's corruption and incompetence. He would remain on the Council, working together with Fraga as a vocal advocate of economic liberalization, but it had been a painful loss indeed.\n\nTorcuato Fernández-Miranda, Minister-Secretary of the Movimiento Nacional, had been one of the longest serving Ministers of Franco's Spain, and had recently emerged as one of the best known and most powerful voices in the Council. His famous ability to negotiate and converse with conservative and Falangist leaders had been essential in ensuring that his ambitious reforms passed. But now, he was defeated. His political career was over. He knew it. Fraga and Ullastres knew it. His pained expression and stiff body made his feelings obvious, but he knew as well as anyone else that no amount of passion could save his life's work.\n\nA week later, Fernández-Miranda resigned his position. He returned to Asturias, where he had grown up, purchasing a modest estate in which he planned to spend his remaining years. The position of Minister-Secretary of the Movimiento Nacional now fell to Jose Utrera Molina, a Falangist fanatically devoted to Caudillo Franco. Whatever chance there was of a peaceful transition to democracy, it had now been snuffed out."

 IBR.3134.d:0 "It had taken months to arrange this meeting. Not since the Civil War had leaders of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, General Union of Workers, Syndicalist Party, and Basque Nationalist Party, all been together in the same room. This would be an uneasy meeting, to say the least. Ideological divides threatened any hope at a united opposition.\n\nNine men sat at a quiet private residence in Belem, Brazil. 4 were Iberian dissidents that had been quietly smuggled out of Cádiz. The others were exiles, 3 Portuguese and 2 Spanish, that had not seen Iberia in many years. All saw the rising discontent that had created Iberia's terrorist movements as an opportunity for reform.\n\nThe tension in the room slowly dissipated as the men discussed which content to include in their manifesto. Democratic rights and the legalization of opposition parties were obvious. But were there any parties too extreme to legalize? Should the Iberian Union be dissolved or maintained? Should the culturally distinct regions of Iberia be granted full autonomy?\n\nTo many of the underground dissidents in Iberia, the Belem Manifesto was hardly inspirational. It was too vague in its goals and too unclear in how they hoped to achieve them, and it tried to ignore the obvious question of whether Iberia should be a socialist state. But others saw something else: A consensus between liberal and leftist activists in Iberia, whose differences had previously prevented cooperation. Its calls for increasing the rights of workers to organize and working to improve the wellbeing of citizens through increased state intervention, struck a compromise between the calls for revolution and the call for more limited reform."

Under the shadow of the café's awning, summer in Madrid's outdoors could be tolerable, even in his brand new woolen suit.\n\n\"I don't know why the exiles refuse to just look at the situation, their recent changes in rhetoric makes everyone left of Franco look insane.\" He chuckled a bit before continuing.\n\n\"Well, you were one of the fanatics yourself.\" Indeed, his friend had been arrested by Salazar's goons more than once.\n\nSitting to his left, and cleaning his glasses, the third man, a Sevillian, gave a nod of agreement before laughing at his joke. \"Look, I am a Marxist at heart, but we can't ignore reality. What we need is a party like what they have in the United States, what's his name... Harrington.\"\n\nAll three nod in cynical agreement. \"I think we could just get something like that here, hell, the Church might even like it.\"\n\nThe Portuguese in the group decided to retort. \"Yeah that's all well and good, but what do we do about all the people that worked for them?\" They knew that the Caudillos' favorite underlings would never get a trial, no matter what Jiménez de Asúa and his other exiles wanted to believe.\n\n\"We could get ahead of the curve, you know. If we can get first shot at being the only reasonable people to the left of Fraga...\"\n\nHe thought for a moment about it, Felipe Gonzales: President of the Iberian Federation. He could get used to that idea.

The Axencia has now become aware of a particularly concerning conspiracy: Multiple FSLP members are using the shelters to spread anti-government, Portuguese separatist, and Communist propaganda. \"J\", a 18 year old male living in one of the shelters reported that two friends and one volunteer worker invited him for drinks, and after prodding him with several questions regarding his political beliefs, offered to invite him into the FSLP with promises of 'saving Portugal', and of obtaining higher social status.\n\nAfter contacting the AAS, \"J\" was signed on as an informant, and has provided us with a list of 11 other FSLP members, as well as revealing a plan to expand FSLP influence within the camps to foment a city-wide movement of 'minor sabotage' against the government."

 IBR.30158.d:0 "Living conditions continue to recover in Lisbon. Though the homelessness rate remains higher than before, most of the people displaced by the storm live with relatives in other cities, in shanty towns just outside the city, or in tenements within. Most buildings have either been repaired or demolished, and the scars of the destruction are fading quickly.\n\nWhile the housing situation improves rapidly, the recovery of employment has stagnated. Businesses suffered severely, with many factories and stores alike being badly damaged or destroyed entirely. Local government officials have been ineffective at preventing, and at times have even been complicit in, predatory lending that has forced business owners to choose between losing their businesses, or having their businesses weighed down by interest for years to come. Lacking any source of income, thousands of Lisboans now rely almost exclusively on government support to survive.\n\nFew doubt that Lisbon's economy will eventually recover, but even fewer deny that the current situation remains poor. Various advisors have suggested launching a stimulus program in order to accelerate Lisbon's recovery, however, such a program could be significantly more costly than any of our previous relief efforts."

 IBR.30159.d:0 "In times of crisis, false rumors spread easily. When people have lost so much, they struggle to find meaning in their suffering. But nothing breeds conspiratorial thinking quite like a real conspiracy. Rumors now circulate that a journalist working for one of the largest Portuguese-language newspapers was being heavily censored by the government, to downplay the severity of the situation in Lisbon and bolster government support.\n\nThat rumor is not false, and unfortunately it has found many receptive voices, not just in Lisbon, but across Iberia. People are increasingly questioning the state narrative surrounding the floods, seeing a corrupt and incompetent government brushing its sins under the carpet, rather than a heroic intervention to save the people of Lisbon. This is seriously harming public support for our relief effort."

Such visible protests are very rare in Iberia, usually met with police crackdowns. They are here to protest against what they perceive as the negligent mishandling of the Lisbon Flood by the Iberian government; insufficient funding to relief efforts, corrupt officials exploiting vulnerable Lisboans for personal financial gain, and continued economic deterioration.\n\nThese are the largest protests Lisbon has seen in many years, and the unusual circumstances in which they are occurring has left advisors conflicted on what the optimal government response would be."

 IBR.30161.d:0 "Carlos' boots were covered in dirt, not unlike the night of the flood. Today was a good day, the cool January wind kept him cool as he laboriously shoveled dirt out of the trench. He was not making as much as he did at the cannery, but really, he was just happy to have a job at all. The weeks after the Flood had been hard, but even with his old job, old car, and old house gone, life was starting to feel normal again. Just the knowledge that his work might prevent future floods greatly motivated him, and gave him some sense of purpose. Sunset signaled the end of a productive workday. If only he still had a vehicle of his own, so that he did not have to walk a mile back from work. And if only the elevator were not broken, so that he did not have to climb three flights of stairs to reach his apartment.\n\n\"Papai! Papai!\" shouted his exuberant daughter. \"Mom got me a new Mariquita!\" Carlos exchanged a knowing glance with his wife. On some days, little Maria Francisca seemed to have been more heartbroken by the loss of her doll in the flood than the loss of their home. His work had paid off, his family had recovered yet another piece of their old lives.\n\n\"She's been yapping about that thing all evening!\" exclaimed his jovial roommate, embracing Carlos and patting him on the back. \"You do good work.\" That was one of the unusual things about life after the flood. With so many homes destroyed, it was now common for individual apartments to be rented to multiple families. But Vítor was a pleasant man, someone who genuinely enjoyed the company of Carlos and his family. Carlos could once again listen to the same radio shows he did at his old house with his daughter. Life was never the same after the flood, life never could have stayed the same. But life did continue."

Loud arguing, barely muffled by thin walls, was now a constant. Then, the power went out. \"Fuck! Again?\" screamed a roommate.\n\nHaving to live with two other families in an apartment no larger than her old house ruined any hope Gabriela had had of returning to a sense of normalcy. That Senhor Gusmão was such a miserable man. It was better than the camp, at least.\n\nHer husband Carlos came through the door, smelling of the sea. \"I might just strangle him some day.\" Gabriela chuckled. Her husband's dry humor was one of the few joys in life that the flood had not destroyed. \"If the power comes back on, I have mackerel for us to share.\"\n\n\"One of these days, can you reel in a drink instead?\" Carlos smiled and sat next to his wife, wrapping his arm around her and leaning into her body.\n\nLife had not been so good after the flood. Gabriela often found herself wishing she were still a child, not having to worry about the awful apartment, and not knowing the pain of losing a home. But feeling her husband's embrace, seeing her son's smile, hearing her sleeping daughter's breath, those kept her moving forward. The city was recovering."

No electricity meant no heat, made worse by the wind that constantly leaked through the entrance.\n\nSeven weeks ago, Carlos de Almeida lost his home. He sat beside his wife Gabriela, in a shack that creaked with every strong gust of wind. Carlos was terrified that he had made a mistake while building it, and the roof would collapse onto them. At least here, he could keep some semblance of his dignity. Not long ago, Carlos could rely on a steady wage from his job at the cannery. Now, he helped neighbors build their own shacks in return for cigarettes or food. And what cigarettes he did not smoke, he could trade those for more food.\n\nSeven weeks ago, Maria Francisca de Almeida lost her home. She lay in the shack with her parents, exhausted as she often was, and sleeping at an hour she once had been filled with energy. She wet the bed again, to her mother's dismay. It had not been a problem before the flood. Now, there was scarcely a night it did not happen. Once, Francisca was filled with joy, and a thirst for adventure and new experiences. Now, she hardly ever left her mother's side.\n\nSeven weeks ago, Luís Maria de Almeida lost his home. In a way, his parents envied him. Too young to realize just how much he had lost. Too young to even comprehend where he was. But even he could feel the cold January air against his nape, and even he could sense that something had changed."

But the people walk along sidewalks knowing that just a few weeks ago, they were covered in debris. They sleep in bedrooms they had never seen before that late November night.\n\n[?Root.IBR_lisbonflood_loss]. That is how many people the newspapers think have died. But who is to say what the true number is? Who became ill in the evacuee shelters and died, and were they included? How many committed suicide, having seen their lives fall apart so suddenly? What could have been done to prevent such a horrible flood? Is Iberia doing enough now to make sure such a thing never happens again?\n\nLisbon comes back to life, returning to its place as Europe's westernmost great city. But it is forever changed. The flood of November 1967 will forever be remembered as the worst natural disaster to occur anywhere in the Iberian Peninsula in over two centuries, and as a major test in the ability of the young Iberian Union to react to crisis."

As the coasts of Algeria disappeared into the distance, the man wondered how much his birthplace had changed since he last saw it.\n\nPortugal was but a distant memory, a home he had left to pursue life overseas, lured away by promises of fame and fortune. First came Angola, a harsh exotic land. He had earned his living hacking roads from the jungle, carving plantations from the wilderness, and bringing civilization to an untamed continent. Until the Germans marched in and forced them out, while Lisbon stood by and watched.\n\nThen came Algeria, where he worked alongside his Spanish brethren, carving a place for himself and his fellow exiles, the Retornados. The desert was a harsh mistress, but he had managed until the War came and went, and he was once again without a land to call home.\n\nThe hours passed quickly, few of his fellow Retornados were in the mood to talk, hushed voices and whispered words, worried parents, and confused children. The only ones willing to speak were the soldiers, young, angry, and resentful, with too much to drink and too little to do.\n\nAs the coast of Portugal came into view, António didn't know what to feel.

Initially the ultimate question remained even with the acquisition of the anarchist's testimonies. He confirmed that the servant worked undercover for the anarchist cell while he worked for the noble family. But where were they? Had the pair moved with the cell to Asturias? Had they been hidden somewhere else entirely? If they had met with the anarchists in Barcelona why would they have continued moving further once the servant had left the organization, as the anarchist relayed during his interrogation?\n\nIt already put a great distance between the former reality the two wanted to escape.

He took note of a particularly large and out of place sum, and moved his attention towards gaining a better insight into the property market of Barcelona.\n\nAfter months of anonymous calls and information perusal he finally had triangulated a small apartment which seemed to match both the time frame and withdrawal amount.

Now it was over, before him lay the address he had tracked the missing pair to. A small flat in Barcelona, nothing befitting a wealthy heiress, but he was sure it was a happy home, nonetheless. Picking up the receiver of the phone next to him he briefly stalled. Many thoughts crossed his troubled mind as he carefully considered his next action. With a grim determination he however finally entered the number he knew he needed to call. A chirpy voice answered on the other end informing the inspector that he was indeed speaking to the Municipal Police of Valladolid and then asked what it was he was calling about. Ensuring not to mention his name the inspector gave the information he had now worked years to obtain. All he could manage after the call was a long sigh.\n\nNot even an hour later the phone rang again waking the inspector out of his daze.

With slightly raised eyebrows he read that the couple he had searched for so long had indeed been found in the place where he had traced them to. There however was no mention of the anonymous tip he had left, instead all the praise was laid at the feet of a former sergeant who now had been honorably promoted. Smirking sadly, he tossed the paper away to look at the letter. Instantly taken aback, he saw that it was from his former superior. The department knew that his work had been important in resolving the case. His old boss stressed that he had always known that the inspector would be able to resolve this terrible ordeal. Considering the current political climate and the serious breaches the inspector had committed he would not be able to regain his position on the force.

Maybe halfway through, but it had only become noticeable for him when he held a glass and watched the liquid slosh around, spilling over the rim. It took willpower and concentration to drink from his mother's tea set without making a mess, and Manuel took almost as much satisfaction from mastering his hands as he did from the tea.\n\nThe set was the same his mother had owned before he left for the Portuguese colonies, good porcelain painted with blue glazing, in the style of azulejos. It had been her most valued possession back in the 30's, and only brought out on special occasions. Much in the living room had not changed. The photos on the walls, the furniture, the little figurine of Saint Anthony upon the cabinet.\n\nMany other things were different, of course. His father died of bowel cancer in 1957, he had been told on the way to Lisbon. His mother was old, deeply wrinkled, her hair stark white. His siblings were now about as old as his parents were when he had left. The change that he expected to be the most dramatic was the fact that his country no longer existed. Except it did, in a sense, and he felt no great difference living in Iberia than he had in Portugal.\n\nHomes had television sets, and the cars and clothes were all strange to him, but in the end he was drinking tea from the same tea set, under the same roof, in the same city with the same streets. It felt as if the places and the people he once knew had been replaced and were now pretending to be his Portugal. Manuel knew it was silly, but the feeling could not be erased any more than he could stop his hands from shaking."

A dozen performers followed him on the stage as the band started back up and the actors broke into song.\n\nIn the span of ten minutes, the crowd began to chuckle, then giggle, then roar with laughter and applause as the play hit them with one ridiculous sketch after another. It was a rambunctious, merciless parody of such topics as private property, advertising, television, imperialism, family, sex and the rich. The crowd found it to be vibrant, joyful, and as hilarious as it was transgressive. Just a year ago such a play would never have made it through the censors. The atmosphere was thrilling, as if the audience was collectively indulging in their favorite guilty pleasure.\n\nCritics had been right: Castañuela 70 was unlike anything ever presented in Iberia and, despite the denouncement from conservative sectors, it appeared as if Iberians had an appetite for precisely this kind of comedy."

Now, with the release of his newest studio album \"Mediterráneo\", singer-songwriter Joan Manuel Serrat has undeniably become one of the country's major cultural exports, topping the charts across the Hispanic and Lusophone worlds.\n\nNicknamed \"El Noi del Poble-sec\" after the Barcelona neighborhood where he grew up, Serrat's particular blend of strident singing, nostalgic lyrics, classic guitar and orchestral backing band has captivated listeners worldwide. Tours throughout the Americas have earned him awards and televised performances in Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Argentina, on top of his enormous popularity at home.\n\nAn early member of the so-called \"Nova Cançó\", a movement to revitalize Catalan music, Serrat is no stranger to politics. The son of an anarchist who was part of the CNT during the Civil War, the AAS had kept an eye on his activities since he first came to prominence in the mid-60's, censoring several songs in Catalan and others critical of the Caudillos. Since the turn of the decade, Serrat's politics appear to have mellowed out, and his singing in Spanish now draws criticism from Catalans that he has \"sold out\".

Televisions had been ubiquitous in Iberian households for a while now, but with little to watch besides the news and subtitled American TV shows, no one show was anywhere near universally watched. Un, dos, tres is different.\n\nA huge ad campaign preceded the release of Iberia's first television game-show, and when the first episode aired on April 24th, it somehow exceeded the already high expectations of excited viewers.\n\nWhere other shows have one theme and stuck to it, contestants in Un, dos, tres have three rounds. In the first 'Question' round, 3 couples compete to give as many answers to questions as possible without a wrong answer or repeating a previous answer. The winning couple gets to skip a round, while the two losing couples have to face each other in a second 'Elimination' round, in which contestants face physical challenges, of which the winners face the winners of the first round in the third 'Auction' round. Before that, though, an intermission with dancing, music, and sometimes comedy sketches, plays. The 'Auction' round has contestants participate in various gambling games for money and prizes, different games every episode. In the final part of the show, they would negotiate with the host for either cash or a final prize, ranging from worthless gag-prizes to luxurious prizes worth many thousands of pesetas.\n\nUn, dos, tres is made by and for Iberian audiences, with episodes filmed in Spanish but also dubbed for broadcast in Portugal. With the enormous amount of viewership the show has seen in just its first few episodes, Televisión Iberia is already trying to negotiate for episodes of the show with foreign subtitles to air elsewhere in Europe."

This once-quiet beach 6 miles north of Bilbao has become something of a tourist attraction in recent years. Travelling there requires no special planning, but nonetheless carries a certain aura of adventure. The Karlsson family had been quite anxious to travel there. Temperate enough that the summer sun was not too painful and the risk of sunburn low, but still warm enough that swimming was enjoyable. Surfing, too, if only they could figure out how to stay balanced on a board.\n\nBut it would be foolish to swim amidst the Atlantic waves after sunset, with nobody to see or hear you if you were pulled into the deep. And so, after many hours that had left the Karlssons satisfied and sore, it was time to return to the hotel. Yes, the hotel--where was it again? There were countless hotels in Sopelana, none particularly distinctive. Johann was beginning to regret picking an inexpensive hotel farther from the beach. Wandering on the streets, the Karlssons became more concerned as the sky turned ever darker. Finally, they caved in. It was time to get some help. \"Hotel? Hotel?\" Johann asked to someone he presumed was a local.\n\n\"¿Si, cual hotel?\"\n\nJohann tried to remember what the hotel looked like, and in his best Spanish choked out \"Hotel. Aah.. blanca... blanca hotel, av farmaci! Blanca hotel av farmaci, y de grande calle.

 IBR.3200.d:0 "In the early decades of the 19th century, after Portugal had ended its inquisition, hundreds of wealthy Jews came to the Azores. Free of the tax obligations on the peninsula itself, their businesses could thrive there. Thus, Porta Delgada became the beating heart of Portugal's Jewish community. But that was a century ago, and now, most of the Jews of Porta Delgada did not possess the wealth that their ancestors had. Most now worked for Catholic employers, facing the same problems that Jews everywhere had faced for centuries.\n\nLongshoreman Salvator Abohbot knew this well. His supervisor seemed to always suspect him of making mistakes, looking at him like he was a criminal. He had a penchant for screaming at workers for \"laziness\", but was especially aggressive toward Salvator. Everyone knew Salvator was Jewish, of course, his surname was a dead giveaway. And Salvator was not alone in suspecting that that was the reason why his supervisor was particularly hard on him.\n\nA few days ago, after Salvator and another employee received a particularly egregious punishment, the workers started talking. Their supervisor was a short-tempered and hateful man. He had no regard for their safety. Tomorrow, they were going to stop working. At 10:00AM, they left the harbor. Their supervisor screamed, declaring this an illegal strike. But his workers didn't come back. Instead, they went to the media.\n\nThe story spread, and by the next morning the dailies widely reported on the protest--and Salvator's explanation of what triggered it. Perhaps a censor had approved the interview without reading it, or didn't think it inflammatory, but that afternoon dozens of longshoremen, other workers, and Jews from across the city joined in a public protest. When police came to break up the protest, the situation escalated into a minor riot. Three buildings were torched, and more than 30 demonstrators, among them Salvator Abohbot, had been arrested. These are the largest protests that the Azores have ever seen, and they reveal long hidden tensions between the Jews, the laborers, and the employers of Porta Delgada."

But many other people are, truth be told, quite pleased to hear that the man is finally dead. They would not dare to say it in public, but the disdain Grandes held towards reform, towards even the barest deviation from his hardline conservatism, made him a symbol of everything wrong with the Iberian government in the eyes of liberals and reformists across the peninsula.

But she could offer a warm meal every night, a mattress to sleep on, a chance to learn the Gospels, perhaps, even, offer a conversation to a lonely boy or girl. Ramira joined the Auxilio Social because she cared for children and could understand their pain.\n\nA lot had changed in the decades since mother's death. The Nationalists won the war, and molded the Auxilio Social into an institution to provide for, educate, and indoctrinate, orphaned youths. After the Union formed, she was chosen to lead operations in the Portuguese city of Setúbal. And now, after the end of the Caudillos' reign, the new government had shuttered Auxilio Social entirely on account of its propagandizing. But Ramira wasn't going to stop living after her mom died, she wasn't going to give up working after Auxilio Social was dissolved.\n\nAfter receiving her husband's permission, Ramira purchased the Auxilio Social building. By soliciting donations and recruiting former coworkers, she would rebuild the Auxilio Social, at least in Setúbal. It would take a while to recover from the loss of government support.

They have gathered to witness the final game of the Caudillos' Cup, and excitement is through the roof. This is sure to be the most widely seen sporting event in Iberian history, with over half of the population tuning in to witness the match by Television or Radio.\n\nThe Caudillos' Cup was founded in 1949, a tournament in which the 14 teams of Portugal's Primeira Liga, 16 teams of Spain's La Liga, and 2 Colonial teams have faced off. Though intended to promote Pan-Iberian pride, Portuguese fans have in recent years found themselves disappointed. The last time a Portuguese team won the cup was in 1957, and in every year since 1960, the Final has been played between 2 Spanish teams. Real Madrid is near universally agreed to be the best team in the country, having won all but 2 championship games in the past 10 years. However, Portuguese team S.L. Benfica has seen increasing success in recent years, and after defeating Atlético Madrid in the semifinals, now faces Real Madrid for the title of 1970 Champion.\n\nReal Madrid's star player Amancio Amaro had an excellent shot at the goal 4 minutes into the game, but it was successfully covered by Benfica's goalkeeper José Henrique. Henrique is one of the best goalkeepers Iberia has ever seen, and his ironclad defense held against Madrid's offense many times through the match. At 35 minutes, Benfica's António Simões scored a surprise goal, sending Portuguese fans, and for that matter Spaniards rooting for the underdog, into near hysterical celebration.\n\n71 minutes in, Real Madrid's Manuel Velázquez set up an extraordinary cross to Francisco Gento, scoring a goal and tying the game 1-1. At 73 minutes, a tragedy: José Henrique twists his ankle while blocking a shot. Benfica has lost perhaps its single most valuable player, with the much less experienced backup Manuel Bento taking his place. Madrid's offense redoubles their efforts, but Bento holds on. Tension builds across the nation as the game nears its 90th minute, and at 88 minutes, Benfica's António Simões prepares to head the ball.

Living in the late 6th century BC, the king would have likely had contact with some of the first Greek traders to come to Iberia's shores, the new trade routes bringing him and his kingdom great wealth. The artistic depiction of the gods covering his tomb are heavily evocative of Phoenician and Neo-Hittite influence. Unfortunately, he died around 500 BC, mere decades before writing was brought to Iberia, and no remains of his body could be found at the excavation site. As such, neither the size nor name of his kingdom, nor his identity, accomplishments, or lifestyle, can be determined.\n\nNonetheless, the discovery of the mausoleum has stirred great excitement within the archaeological community, being both one of the oldest and one of the largest artifacts left by the poorly understood ancient Iberian peoples."

He had a talent for exactly copying paper drawings into real dresses, fitted perfectly to both the desire and form of his patrons, and soon his boutique developed into a small, regionally popular fashion brand. Ingratiating himself with the French fashion design community, he moved to Paris to escape the Civil War and to New York to escape the World War. His designs for Hollywood and Broadway stars made him one of the most famous and influential fashion designers in world history.\n\nWhat distinguished Balenciaga most from other fashion designers was his challenging of fashion norms, and of what 'fashion design' itself meant. At a time when 'high fashion' usually meant dresses to highlight the figures of tall, attractive young women, Balenciaga frequently designed for older women, short women, and overweight women. He made designs which hid rather than accentuated hips and breasts. His best known and most influential design was his \"baby-doll dress\" which mimicked the conservative and highly feminine appearance of dresses of 19th century aristocrats, but which did not require a corset.\n\nNearly all fashion lines today have been inspired or changed in some way by Balenciaga. His decision to retire and return to Iberia in 1968 signalled the end of an era for fashion worldwide, including in Iberia itself. Universally agreed to be the greatest Iberian fashion designer in history, news of his death made headlines worldwide, with hundreds of magazines publishing long memoirs to him and his work."

The Green Years centers around Julio's attempts to find a place for himself in urban society, as well as the harsh realities of everyday life.

This backfired, triggering sizable anti-government student protests. The anniversary of the first protest has come to be known as \"Students' Day\", and once a year, reform-minded Iberian students peacefully protest for greater academic freedom, trusting that their youth and high social status will deter police retaliation.\n\nIn the past four years, these protests have become more explicitly anti-government and radical in their demands. Thus, 6 weeks ago the Caudillos prohibited all Students' Day events indefinitely. While most would-be protestors caved to the demands, students at the University of Lisbon arranged a massive strike: as many as 70% of students have stopped attending classes and turning in assignments. They not only demand the reversal of the Students' Day ban, but for wider freedom of speech and organization on campus, and an end to racially and ideologically motivated restrictions on student admissions.\n\nThis protest received little attention at first, leading organizers to adopt a more extreme approach: a mass hunger strike. Over 1000 students filled the UoL's cafeteria, in the single largest protest in Portugal since Salazar took office. The protests must end, lest images of malnourished students appear in the press--or worse.\n\nBoth Caudillos favor the obvious option of sending police to detain the students for a few days and suck the life out of the protest. Some reformist advisors fear that this could backfire and lead to more outrage. Notably, current rector of UoL and former high-ranking minister Marcello Caetano has argued that most of the students' demands are reasonable, and acceding to those demands would weaken support for the other, unacceptably radical proposals. Other advisors bite back that giving the protestors an inch will only encourage more radical protests in the future.\n\nUltimately, however, the Caudillos would not stand idly by as their authority was challenged."

In broad strokes he is supportive of the ideology and policies espoused by Salazar, but he is also an outspoken proponent of sweeping education reform. Though he was a prominent member of the Portuguese government during the 1940s, Franco's deep suspicions of Caetano and his intentions led to him being sidelined upon the establishment of the Union. While he continues to maintain a regular correspondence with Salazar and serves as one of his advisors in unofficial capacity, he holds no office and it is doubtful he will anytime soon.\n\nStill, as one of the only Portuguese reformers both liked and respected by Salazar, it is not unthinkable that Caetano might one day return to prominence."

Food was more expensive these days, and Umaro was not about to let his family starve, even if it forced him to commit theft. Alas, the rice-seller alerted an officer whom Umaro had not seen, and as Umaro tried to flee, 20 kilograms of stolen rice weighed him down.\n\nHis wife and children had to join him in the orchard. If they refused, how would they eat? Little Harouna, all of four years old, gathered cashew fruits that had fallen to the ground alongside his seven year old sister Duwa. Umaro and his wife Jainaba sat at the shelling station, hammering at the cashew shells to expose the nuts within. Dust entered Jainaba's lungs, and she struggled to breathe as particles of toxic resin lodged itself in her windpipe. Umaro's left hand was blistered from the resin, his glove having partly torn, and needing to work another 40 hours to 'purchase' a new one.\n\nThe lodging was paltry at best: Blankets sprawled over a concrete floor, each man, woman, and child, packed side by side. Bathing consisted of being stripped naked in a line outdoors and sprayed down with hoses. The food was even worse. A bowl of rice twice a day. On Sundays Fufu, bland and unflavored. A tablespoon of peanut sauce or pepper sauce could be purchased for 10 hours work, but with frequent fines, most could not hope to afford this more than once a week.\n\nThe punishments were cruel and frequent on these long, 12 hour shifts. Move too slowly or too sloppily and be caned by the overseer's baton, or be fined for many hours pay. Try to rest for a second and risk being shocked by cattle prod. Many of the workers had scars on their faces, necks, and limbs. Women were typically scarred in other ways. The more 'creative' overseers had even collected resin to paint the skins of those punished, such that blisters would form into patterns and shapes.\n\nThese were facts of life in the orchards of Guiné."

His three and a half decades of authoritarian rule came to an end, and now, so has he.\n\nTo his supporters, he was the man who saved Spain from Bolshevism and Nazism, restored Spain to its Catholic roots, and created the Iberian Union. To those opposed to him, he was the monster responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands in the civil war, a man who oppressed women, native peoples, political opponents and regional minorities, to a truly abhorrent extent.

Being married to one of Iberia's top diplomats didn't exactly harm her political career either.\n\nAll that said, besides the novelty of having a woman in office, Careaga was not especially different than any other Iberian mayor.

 IBR.4112.d:0 "The university dorm room had seemed entirely ransacked, and by all means, would have been mistaken for a crime scene had it not been for the trio of students occupying the dinner table, metal cabinets, and wooden chairs, all bound together by a thick layer of paperwork, a lifeboat of desperation amid a sea of quiet contemplation of the future. The lights had long since been preemptively shut off by the students in anticipation of the power being shut off, and what little refrigerated foods remained in the house now laid on plates sitting on the collection of tables, staining rings into the printed paper, warmed only by the candles which lay on tin plates, serving as a fire hazard and absolute necessity to the terrified graduates.\n\n\"Mateo, what options do we still have?\" Carlita rapped her fingers on her collection of papers, half of them redundant. \"Right, I think we've got this firm out of Lisbon, but we don't speak a word of Portuguese-\" Santiago raised his hand. \"-Except for me-\" \"-except for Santiago,\" Mateo confirmed, and continued: \"so he's got that option if he really wants to move back, but as for us, I just don't know...\"\n\n\"Oh, don't act so ungrateful! We could always work as janitors for pennies on the dollar for our scholarships!\" Santiago let out a heave of laughter, hushed by the fact he was the only one laughing.\n\nCarlita let out a sigh and pinched her eyebrows together. \"Honestly, that is sounding more attractive by the minute, because I am not spending my years and diploma on a dog-shit job in slum-ville Madrid, might be worth it to actually just take the job and save face.\" The room went quiet, and the thought of the unthinkable bubbled up in their minds, like water boiling until steam came forth. For this trio of students, this steam was a candle extinguishing. \"What if we left for Italy?\" The words escaped Mateo's mouth just as easily as a sneeze would have, and the other two in the room reacted as if it had."

Now, however, the lobbies were filled with tearful goodbyes, and the gates were choked with a bizarre mix; businessmen with packed suitcases and gaudy suits, families with a collection of half-empty cloth bags, and a pair of ex-students, chatting in the dull smog of their cigarettes. \"Mateo, you and your family, were you close?\" Santiago looked up from the floor, and took another drag on his cigarette, his eyes watering through the cloud of smoke.\n\n\"Sure, we were close, kinda. We talked once in awhile, I'd make sure to visit around once a month, but I always made the holidays. I made some kinda amends with my pops, and so long as this whole gamble works out well, there won't be anything to worry about in terms of patching things up.\" The gaze of the two flicked back to the floor, the gentle din of conversation around them muting their thoughts on the subject. At that moment, Carlita walked to the duo of smokers, letting out a deep sigh of exasperation, and letting in a breath of smoke, which started a coughing fit she could hardly stifle.\n\n\"How'd that go? Your folks doing alright?\" Santiago asked, Carlita hardly recomposed from the smoke.\n\n\"Oh, sure, they're just fine, thanks. At least my parents can say they know I'm out of the country. They're not exactly sweating this 'stagnation' stuff, they're not exactly losing sleep or zeroes out of this, right?\" She grinned, and leaned against the wall, fishing around her pockets for a stray cigarette. Santiago looked back to the floor, and took another drag. Mateo looked through the smoke around him, his friends hardly visible through its veneer. He could not be for certain, though he could have sworn that he saw some beads of water in his close friend's eyes."

Sarah looked at him and smiled.\n\n\"You haven't come this far for cold feet, don't kid yourself. They'll forgive you, and you don't even know if they're upset, c'mon.\" She extended her arm towards Mateo. He smiled back and took her hand. Walking towards the small crowd of people looking out at the returning families, there were a scattered few parents and grandparents, and a pair of parents squinting into the crowd. Stepping to the side of a family embracing their grandparents, Mateo's parents stood there. A beat passed, and their faces lit up as bright as the sun.\n\n\"Mateo! Where've you been?!\"\n\n\"Is this Sarah? She's beautiful!\"\n\n\"Are Americans as miserable as we thought?\"\n\nThe drive home was about as insufferable as Mateo had predicted, if not for the same reasons as he'd feared. Now, however, the true challenge would come. America wasn't exactly everything it was made up to be, and the bigger pay for doctors back home wasn't exactly dissuading. Carlita and Santiago had gotten better luck with finding work in Florida, but Mateo hadn't been as lucky, except for in one particular department. While Grandpa Franco had promised a job for himself -and there was always a job somewhere in Madrid for veterinarians, so Sarah was covered- the issue of finding a place to stay had begun to rear its ugly head, even if the answer was clear as day for the time being. Looking to Sarah talking with his parents in the rudimentary Spanish she did know, however, Mateo felt a spark of hope in his chest."

 IBR.4115.d:0 "\"DEATH TO THE BUREAUCRATS! STOP THE STEAL! END THE PRODUCTION HIKES!\"\n\nBy the time Marcos had arrived, a small crowd had gathered in front of Espinoza Farm, curious to see what the disturbance was. As he turned off his police siren and parked his car, he could sense something was not quite right. Clawing his way through the shouts and whoops of the crowd, Marcos finally saw what was happening. It was the scorching heat that hit him, causing him to stagger back. In the middle of the farm courtyard, there lay a colossal, brilliant orange fireball. So bright was the fire that none of the spectators could even look at it without squinting.\n\nSurrounding the fire was the Garcia family chanting, as if they were in the middle of some occult ceremony that only they understood. The grizzled patriarch of the farm, Mateo picked up a box of wheat and threw it into the fireplace, where it was immediately ripped apart by the flames.\n\n\"Are you going to arrest me? This is my property!\" Mateo jabbed a finger at Marcos, scowling. The crowd quietened, and Marcos recognised most of the gathering from the local farmer markets in Toledo that he used to visit with his father.\n\n\"Mr. Garcia, I understand you're angry about the new policy, bu-\"\n\n\"Angry? I've barely enough food to feed my family, and those bastards want more? Why not take it all away, then? In fact, why not just shoot me? Would that please those white-collar rats?\" The soft murmuring of the crowd reached its crescendo as Garcia spoke. Some began to chant the slogans of the Garcias, while others performed impromptu versions of the national anthem.\n\nThis was too much. One policeman - a policeman who was more used to heckling hooligans than dealing with a protest - wasn't going to be able to handle this. As he turned to his car, Marcos realised that he could see a smoke plume on the horizon. Then, another popped up. Then another, peppering the entire horizon with the black fury of the working farmer."

 IBR.4116.d:0 "Four men sat around the table in a small Madrid office. At one end sat Segismundo Lozano, wealthy investor and former logging magnate. At the other sat his fellow investors Juan Esteban and Aquilino Nieto. Old acquaintances traded cordial greetings and confident handshakes, but the pleasantries ended as Aquilino slid a small stack of papers across the table. Lozano skimmed the first page of the report before him: Forestry exports were... falling? \"Gentleman, what am I looking at here?\"\n\nAquilino replied, \"Part of a report on the primary sector. Independently commissioned.\"\n\nLozano's brow furrowed. No, those numbers didn't seem right. That didn't seem right at all. Production quotas were 5% higher this year, specifically in order to promote exports. The government had made certain of that. How could sales fall that much, that quickly? \"20 percent?! Are you sure all this is correct?\"\n\n\"Never been more certain in my life.\" Aquilino paused for a moment. \"It's based on a mountain of data, ship manifests, business' sale numbers, a whole bunch else, and we're seeing the same patterns in every city. The additional production... I can't say where it all went, but it ain't being sold\"\n\nJuan interjected \"It's the 'reforms'. Availability's a crapshoot and the quality has plummeted.\"\n\nLozano looked with suspicion. \"No, no that isn't right. Even bad wood sells. If it isn't selling, the Caudillos have greater plans for it. Building more housing, perhaps. Or a strategic reserve.\"\n\nAquilino and Juan shared a quick glance. Maybe Lozano was right, he certainly knew the industry better than they did. And the government kept promising self-sufficiency, a second Industrial Revolution to free Iberia from the shackles of international capitalism, and restore the peninsula's place as a world power. But then again, if that's really what they're doing..."

 IBR.4117.d:0 "Segismundo Lozano, Juan Esteban, and Aquilino Nieto sat around a table once more. But now the blinds were shut and the mood was somber. The small stack of papers was replaced by several dozen in a binder, organized into a dossier that now sat before the retired Lozano skimmed through pages of data, and as his eyes raced over each line, his face contorted into a scowl. \"My God you two, how did you even obtain all this?\"\n\nEsteban replied \"We picked it up from some old friends at the INI. Mostly logistics, some more precise trade data too... it paints quite the picture, as I'm sure you notice.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that it does. These production numbers are nonsense. You didn't pay anything for this, did you?\" He shook his head as he flipped to a bookmarked page, but seeing the numbers laid before him, his whole body froze. Nearly a third of Iberia's wood unsold, nearly 80% of that rotting, and similar numbers across a dozen vital industries.\n\n\"Oh... nice one fellas.\" His hands began to tremble. \"You put a lot more effort into this than the last one.\" Esteban and Nieto exchanged a worried glance. The room went quiet, save the sound of Lozano's excited breathing. He gritted his teeth, body shaking, and shouted \"You really expect me to fall for this? This is a con, isn't it Juan? Trying to make me sell my portfolio to you?\"\n\nEsteban and Nieto sat in solemn silence. Lozano's tearful eyes darted between the two men, looking for some movement, no matter how slight, anything that would betray their true intentions. He found none. \"Why... why are you even telling me this? What do you gain?\"\n\nEsteban spoke up \"You are my friend, Sigismundo. The people of Iberia will soon know the truth, and I want to give you a warning. Liquidate your assets, buy as much USD as you can, and take your family out of the country.

Guillermo could practically feel his manager watching it grow.\n\n\"We'll have everything fixed soon,\" Guillermo replied. The woman stood silently. \"Now ah, I do still need you to pay for that.\"\n\n\"For 6 pesetas?\"\n\nThe manager placed himself at the register, \"No! That bread costs six and a half pesetas, we've kept the price as low as possible. If you're not going to pay, I'm going to have to ask you to leave my store.\" Grumbling under her breath, the woman slammed some coins on the table and absconded with her bread before Guillermo had even counted them.

Ahead of her was a monument in all but name, a colossus of steel and glass taller than any oak tree and so long she could not quite tell where it ended. Above its entrance, spelled in bright golden letters, \"GALERIAS PRECIADOS\"\n\nConcepción felt smaller than she ever had before walking into the store, seeing dozens of people carrying twice as many bags, mothers with their children, teenage girls with their friends, and well-dressed men, all walking amidst hundreds of tables and racks carrying all manner of clothing and fabrics. At the other end of the store were an assortment of large appliances, dishwashers, toilets, ovens, a distance to her right was a whole section for makeup and jewelry, and as if all that wasn't enough, an escalator led to another floor just as enormous, and with just as varied a selection.\n\nHer friend had described Galerías as a 'walk-in catalog', but it was so much more. French clothes and Italian decorations, Malayan spices and Indian fruit, South African gemstones and American appliances.

New treats, snacks, and whole meals that they had previously only heard of, were now available for purchase right here in the Canaries. And it was all within walking distance of their home! Men, women, and children, now flocked to the store just to get a closer look at what had been brought to them. Kellogg's Breakfast cereals, pre-packaged Italian cheeses, even authentic American cigarettes, all in abundant supply and shockingly affordable.\n\nA husband and wife discussed whether to make burgers. A young boy begged his mother to buy Sugar Frosted Flakes. A tall man purchased the last of the cannoli. José had to work so much harder today.

Geoffrey and Maureen were among them, a young couple seeking a break from the commotion. They stepped into a sleepy diner, many tables and booths, but only a few other customers.\n\n\"Welcome! Welcome!\" shouted the excited owner. \"What can I get for you today?\"\n\nGeoffrey looked around, a bit puzzled. The air smelled of ham, bacon, coffee, and toast, hardly what he'd call lunch fare. \"Have you started serving lunch yet?\"\n\nThe owner stifled a laugh, \"Lunch? It's only 12:45!\"\n\n\"What?

Predictably, most of it is to go to transportation, since crossing half the world is never cheap. As corruption isn't entirely defeatable, a small sum must go as a backup to ensure there's enough payment to cover the transportation. Finally, we have taken the liberty of preparing a grand sendoff ceremony, as they deserve.\n\nThe Iberian reaction was less-than-enthused at the breakdown of payment, but since the money had already been sent there was nothing they could do.

Then, to the offense of human decency, were used as human labor for menial projects. Because of the total mistreatment of the government, they died, alone, far away from home, and were never to see their families again.\n\nSadly, there was no proper explanation for the mistreatment, other than sheer cruelty.

The idea that some would not be able to was a happening that was prepared for, even if it was for a small few. The ceremony would be televised, and anyone from around the country who wished to watch was able to.\n\nAs for the mourning itself, it was exactly as it could be expected. It was solemn and quiet.

Whatever their motivations, the message itself is still legible, remarkably. Indonesia has imprisoned the garrison of the former Portuguese holding in Timor - which we liberated on our march southwards - and Iberia wants them back. We have been redirected to from our client state because, allegedly, we control their prisoner management.\n\nIgnoring that this isn't true, for the sake of maintaining an honorable reputation they'll need to be given a response. All that needs to be said is whether or not they'll be allowed to take them home. It's not a hard proposal to stomach, provided they provide transport.

Our imprisoned brethren would be under strict supervision, and were not to be released. When pressed for a justification, cost was cited. When we offered to pay, we were flatly declined.

There's no reason to change our ruling on their prisoners - after all, no means no. If compromising the independence of a fellow Sphere member is tolerable, then of course Iberia could still be supplied their prisoners.

Even after sustaining the pressure, Japan was still aloof.\n\nSince this didn't work, the next plan was to mention it everywhere else. Every opportunity the prisoners in Timor could be brought up, they were. Where they could not be addressed, a chance was created just for the sake of bringing it up. Unfortunately, none of this seems to work. Therefore, the only option is to keep the pressure up, and in more places than before."

With this development, some have taken the mindset that a re-evaluation of our priorities is in order.\n\nForcing the release of the Iberian prisoners is a move growing in popularity with factions within the government, and appeasing them with the benefit of maintaining good relations with another country is a strong benefit. Of course, this says nothing for our credibility- it is very poor publicity move to renege on such a promise."

If anything, our pushing has driven Japan from a simple no to a fiery refusal.\n\nShould we let this continue, there may be a new development resulting in the release of our prisoners, but in doing so we risk permanent damage to our relations.

They have taken the side of the Timor prisoners, supporting their release.\n\nStopping a crisis will require bending to the public will and releasing the prisoners. Thankfully, this will mean an end to the unceasing diplomatic whining.

Lasting for hours, the public demonstrations carried on until sunset, as the darkening sky made it difficult to coordinate.

Never at any point will they be released, and especially not given transport back to Iberia. Because of our continental separation, we can not do anything. Even if we were closer, we still could not do anything in retaliation. This decision has to be accepted, against our wills.\n\nThe international community has taken a keen interest in this, too - our seeming weakness has been noted, and we have been rendered a laughingstock.

With everyone so invested in their freedom, the response that followed the subject being dropped was predictably severe.\n\nConcentrated in the major cities, but still significant in the countryside, was something that very nearly resembled a riot. Large numbers of people marched against the government, and the hostility was most severe in Lisbon, as Salazar was particularly blamed for losing not only a colony, but the Portuguese in it too. Terrorists and separatists took the opportunity to disguise themselves among the crowds, striking from positions that law enforcement could not engage them from.

In this media statement, the Captain goes on at length to discuss what he perceives as continual oppression from the Caudillos, the noticeable loss of freedoms across Iberia, and mismanagement of the armed forces. Due to the status of this high ranking military officer, and the power he holds, the nation has gone into a frenzy over this breaking news. One can scarcely appear in public without hearing talk of this breaking headline.\n\nStrict rules are placed upon all members of the Iberian military, forbidding them to give opinions to the media without strict approval and guidance from public relations personnel or superior officers. Due to this, the testimony that Captain Galvão gave to the media could see him immediately tried by court martial resulting in a dishonorable discharge. To commence such proceedings we would need to speak to his direct superior officer. However, Captain Galvão's statement appears to be rather popular at this moment, and immediately silencing him might be seen by the public as a move of suppression, furthering this crisis.

Those not facing direct charges within the naval forces are to be closely audited, as we search for any other possible dissidents within the ranks of the Iberian Naval high command.\n\nRear Admiral Valerio, the superior officer of Captain Galvão who defied orders from the Caudillos, was today among the first apprehended in the first wave of these purges. Captain Galvão himself however, whose name now carries significant weight within Iberia, has escaped apprehension. His current whereabouts are unknown. Some speculate that he has fled to South America, while others claim that he may have fled to a hostile nation in search of amnesty and possibly even support.\n\nWhilst the current scope of those affected by the purges is limited, and mostly surrounds those who have supported Captain Galvão, they have only just begun.

Among those captured is Henrique Galvão, who surrendered himself to marine forces once they swiftly stormed the bridge of the ship.\n\nThe United States has already agreed to extradite the Iberian hijackers to us, to be dealt with by our legal system. The Americans, after questioning Galvão, have alerted us of his intentions. The intent of the hijacking was to sail the ship to Portugal, where he intended to incite rebellion within Iberia. Should he have succeeded, he could have proven a true thorn in our side. Our concerns are not dispelled, however. While this one pro-democracy rebel is now in our custody, he did not act alone.

This speech, however, is far more radical. Calling for democracy in Iberia, Galvão encourages the Iberian people to take up arms and to oppose the regime of the Caudillos in any way they can. He claims that any Iberian man or woman can make large strides to remove the Caudillos from office, and that should they wish for a brighter future, they should act radically.\n\nWhilst this speech was little more than revolutionary rubbish, many of our people are abuzz with inspiration from the vile broadcast.

Although internationally considered to be a terrorist, Henrique Galvão and his band of hijackers did not kill any on board the Santa Maria during the seizure of the ship. Following their refuge in Cuba, the Cuban government agreed to provide transportation back to Iberia for the approximate 900 hostages of the vessel.\n\nA wave of teary-eyed friends and family rush forth to meet the disembarking crowd, as the cameras of the media flash in the backdrop. Many among the country feared that many, and even perhaps all, of the hostages would never return to Iberian shores. Contrary to concerns, however, all hostages have now been accounted for.

 iberia.309.d:0 "Within the high governmental offices in Madrid, yet another disagreement erupts between the Caudillos. Following the outbreak of the South African War, the German and American spheres have thrown their weight behind the factions of the Afrikaner Volkstaat and the Dominion of South Africa, respectively. As the conflict drags on, concerns within Iberia grow that the German backed African powers may soon overrun the Dominion of South Africa, creating a dominance of the German sphere within Central to South Africa. The United States has grown increasingly involved in the conflict, with a growing American force being committed to the South African War to prop up the Dominion government.\n\nSalazar argues to an unconvinced Franco that the Iberian nation would benefit greatly through intervention in South Africa. While the front lines of this conflict are far from home, assistance to the Dominion of South Africa against the Germans and the Boers could provide a barrier to the further expansion of German influence within the African continent. Furthermore, Salazar argues that within a continent rife with the rise of new nations, significant favor and influence over a well established state such as South Africa could prove an essential strategic stepping stone in the expansion and maintenance of Iberian influence globally.\n\nThe Caudillos have yet to come to the formal agreement required for any official action to take place, Salazar is unrelenting in his proposals, believing firmly in the necessity of Iberian intervention in South Africa. If either of the Caudillos is to be moved in his opinion, it is likely not to be Salazar."

In further support of our efforts, the Americans have pledged extensive logistical assistance to commence our operations in the region, to ensure a smooth operational launch.\n\nSalazar has proven to be quite elated following this news. Already, thousands of Portuguese soldiers are poised for deployment to South Africa, as thousands more conduct additional training to prepare for near-future deployments. Many in the public remain skeptical, however, of the significance of such a conflict.

More specifically, he states, he believes that Iberia has earned back her former Portuguese colonies in Africa.\n\nWhilst the return of the Portuguese colonies is a favourable fantasy for Salazar, reality is often disappointing. For Iberia to seize these lands for herself once again would likely act counter to the interests of nearly all powers in the region. While we may put forth the argument that we have amply paid for this return in blood, it remains highly uncertain whether the Americans will see things the same way.

The nature of the letter, if one could get around the complexities of diplomatic writing, was a candid request. Salazar expresses to us that, following the significant Iberian contributions in South Africa, Iberia formally requests from the United States that Iberia be allowed to re-occupy her former Portuguese colonies, seized by the Germans in prior decades.\n\nWhilst we understand the Iberian desire to reclaim her former territories following a hard fought conflict, it would be near impossible to retain a positive moral image should we accept. Our public image was one of fighting for freedom and against German imperialism and aggression in the region.

It was our goal in this costly war to combat the colonial sphere of an imperial oppressor, and to guarantee the self-determination of the peoples of South Africa. With this, we believe the Iberian request to be contrary to this goal.\"\n\nSalazar, in a fury, has gone on at length in private of what he perceives as an American betrayal, claiming that the United States has denied Iberia a claim in the spoils of war.

All Portuguese individuals currently residing within South Africa, as a thanks for the immense volume of Portuguese soldiers who fought for them, have been granted official permanent residency status within South Africa. As such, the thousands of Portuguese expats may now legally pursue a largely unrestricted private life.\n\nThis move acts largely as a thanks from the South African government to the brave Portuguese men who put their lives at risk for the continued existence of the South African nation, and as a gesture towards the many who fell in the conflict."

The restaurant, known as \"Nandos\", now boasts five restaurants already in its short existence.

Just as lost as the lives of those men who lay dead in the streets of Cape Town.\n\nFollowing an expensive and strenuous effort by both the United States and Iberia to prop up the nation of South Africa against the overwhelming forces of the Afrika-Schild, the adversity was one that could not be sufficiently overcome. As thousands of brave Portuguese volunteers were sent forth to die in a foreign land, the forces of the Schild continued to press ever farther south, until it was realized by all that this war was one that could not be won. The evacuation of South Africa was swift, with the United States undertaking a large effort to evacuate high value personnel from Cape Town. Tens of thousands of military men boarded ships and aircraft to retreat back home in the final weeks of the South African nation.\n\nAcross Iberia, the defeat in South Africa is seen as an irresponsible military disaster and a humiliation by nearly all, to the point that even Caudillo Franco has noticeably distanced himself from the South African intervention, all too glad to allow Salazar to receive the majority of the backlash for the intervention that was initially proposed by him."

The general has chosen to deploy you folks early, and so we're going to need to get our standards up before you ship out in just over a week...\"\n\nErnesto was hearing, but not listening. He certainly had the dedication to the nation and the cause to listen. He'd been driven by a fiery sense of patriotism when he signed up for a volunteer unit, and it still burned in him. Yet, all he could think of in these dreary eyed moments was that room in Madrid with a glass of water by the bed."

 IBR_COL.3.d:0 "The conversation inside the bomber's cockpit hadn't really been much of a conversation so much as a series of calls and responses between a Dominican and Iberian. Jorge would ask for confirmation on something like landing gear and Manuel would affirm that it was ready to go. In fact, the two hadn't really had a real conversation outside of these robotic snippets of dialogue since Jorge arrived in the Dominican Republic.That very thought was on his mind as the last response adjourned the exchange and an awkward silence set in as they waited to be approved for takeoff. \"You know, Manuel, I don't think I asked you where you're from.\"\n\nThe Dominican replied, \"Right here, actually. We'll be able to see my house when we take off.\" He chuckled.\n\n\"Really?\" Said Jorge in amused disbelief, \"You'll have to point it out.\"\n\n\"Yup, watched this airport spring up before my eyes. I remember watching all the Iberian and Italian cars, full of engineers and architects, driving up to survey the site. Then along came the work crews of Dominicans.\"\n\n\"Wait, Iberians designed this? Huh.\"\n\n\"And we built it. A real symbol of the times, isn't it? Name's a little lengthy, I'd have to say, 'Aeropuerto Internacional General Trujilio' doesn't exactly roll off the tongue well, but I think you guys did a good job. Hopefully one day it'll be used for something other than war.\" The green light from control buzzed over the radio. \"But there's still work to be done.\" Once again the pseudo-conversation of pilot chatter resumed, and the plane soared into the air. After more silence, or as much silence as you could have in a plane tearing through the sky at such speeds, Manuel shouted \"Hey, Jorge, look to your left!\"\n\n\"Why?\""

Iberian rifles, clutched in Dominican hands, destined for battlefields in Colombia in the name of Iberia and the entire hispanic world. Some of them checked their rifles, a habit developed from the innumerable amount of times their Iberian training officers had demanded it. Not that they weren't used to handling rifles, or particularly afraid to use them as one could easily observe from their conversation.\n\n\"Alright, we've got about 5 minutes before we get to camp!\" Shouted the Sergeant, a wide grin on his face as he stood up to rally his men, \"So I want to remind you all why we're here, because in just a few days we'll be joining the fight to take care of those nasty, godless liberals!\" There was a raucous cheer, \"We're going to give 'em hell!\" He added, to the sound of more zealous accolades.\n\n\"You know why? Because we're the Legión Dominicana, proud sons of the Republic! We're the finest fighting force on this godforsaken continent, and we're gonna take it back from those bastards, those rats that want to betray their people!\" Once again, the squad cheered him on. \"Now, who are we?!\"\n\n\"The Legión Dominicana!\" Came the reply as a single, if overlapping, voice of unbridled passion.\n\n\"And what are we here to do?!\"\n\n\"Give 'em hell!\"\n\n\"Damn right! We're going to save the future of our people, or die trying! 'Cause who are we?!\"\n\n\"The Legión Dominicana!\""

 IBR_COL.5.d:0 "Eduardo Guerra was a reserved man for a military officer who followed his orders without complaint - even to Colombia. His interactions with the New Granada government had been largely cordial, and the Portuguese-Iberian officer found himself working closely with the Security Minister León Lozano.\n\nTheir work often meant that they talked regularly, and as time passed, their conversations continued after their meetings, and broached numerous non-work related topics. The conversation on this day soon drifted to faith and belief - as both men were devout Catholics. Today, Eduardo posed a question to the Minister. \"Do you ever wonder if this is truly God's plan for you?\"\n\nLozano didn't answer right away. \"Do you wonder the same?\"\n\n\"Sometimes, in my moments of doubt,\" Eduardo admitted. \"But I do my best to live by Christ's example regardless, and to protect and defend the faithful. I am a soldier, but I am certain this is where God intends me to be.\"\n\n\"It is similar for me,\" Lozano mused, leaning back in his chair. \"This burden is a heavy one to bear. My calling is not yours, but nonetheless God has commanded me, and so I shall follow. This nation, this fallen nation, has strayed from God, and all of us pay the price for the sins of the unbelievers and heretics.\"\n\nEduardo's voice was encouraging. \"Only temporarily, my friend. Have faith, God will see you victorious. He does not abandon his people.\"\n\nLozano smiled. \"Indeed, I know you are right. No, I do not fear defeat, my friend. I see a bright future, one where my nation is united once more, and returned to the faith. I know this task is no easy one, but I have faith in our victory. For who can God be with, if not his faithful?\""
