 POLITICS_WERNER_BEST_DESC:0 "维尔纳·贝斯特是一位坚定的德意志民族主义者，曾加入数个极右党派，因此他在1930年急切地加入纳粹党也就令人不足为奇了。此后，他成为党卫军的一员，利用自己的法律和行政能力为新生的盖世太保组织做出了贡献，并在慕尼黑协调了长刀之夜的行动。1940年，政敌迫使他放弃了在盖世太保中的职位，他转而到法兰西的军事占领政府任职，并在1942年被任命为德国驻丹麦全权代表。维尔纳处在一个尴尬的位置上，因为丹麦仍然获准保留君主制度、内阁以及半民主的议会。德国占领当局做出了许多妥协，他们甚至建议贝斯特不要将丹麦的犹太人运往集中营，以维持与丹麦政府的良好关系。1943年一次恢复普选的尝试以及一系列罢工行动使贝斯特将丹麦带入了德国的军事占领之下，议会遭到解散，但丹麦国王、内阁和大部分官僚机构都完整保留了下来。奇怪的是，贝斯特也没能阻止丹麦绝大多数的犹太人逃亡瑞典，数十年来坊间一直有传言称他是犹太人的同情者。\n\n战争结束后，丹麦仍然处于这种尴尬的不稳定状态。名义上她仍然是个独立国家，但受到德国的密切监管，德国人也一直在威胁恢复军事戒严。贝斯特仍旧在任，他曾短暂地尝试推行广泛的日耳曼化计划。50年代的经济崩溃导致资金枯竭，让计划不得不暂停，但贝斯特仍然希望他的梦想——让丹麦成为大日耳曼国的一部分——有朝一日能够实现。"
 POLITICS_NILS_SVENNINGSEN_DESC:0 "Nils Svenningsen is the personification of the loyal cog in the vast machinery of state, working diligently to keep everything running as smoothly as possible. While some in Germania claim that the former Foreign Minister's loyalties lie more with Denmark than the Reich, his diplomatic record is not to be scoffed at. With a streak of liberal pragmatism matched only by his strict diligence, many are hoping that Svenningsen's ascension to ruler of Denmark following the failed coup by Martinsen's National Socialists may finally herald a period of relative stability in the Protektorat."
 POLITICS_HERMANN_HANNEKEN_DESC:0 "As with most militarists, patience is not a virtue respected by Hermann von Hanneken. Since 1942, he has served the Reich as the chief of police and supreme commander of the Wehrmacht garrison in Denmark, cracking down on dissent and treason. While his strict militarism does not reach the fervent frenzy of Schörner, the officer's concern for the security of the Großgermanisches Reich has led him to take swift action in securing the leadership of Denmark.\n\nVon Hanneken and his loyal clique believe that the complex bureaucracy of Werner Best has created a tight knot around Denmark's throat, a fact well known by Germania. This knot has restricted progression of the nation's Germanization and left it hanging limply as a mere Protektorat in the north. Like Alexander the Great, von Hanneken is ready to sever this rope in one swift motion so that Denmark and its Germanic people at last be integrated into the Reich."
 POLITICS_KNUD_MARTINSEN_DESC:0 "Knud Børge Martinsen's loyalty to the Reich is only superseded by the love for his nation. He has long acted as the Fører of the National Socialist Party of Denmark, serving as the face of the Party while his trusted ally Carl Popp-Madsen acts as its brains. A man of infamous cynicism, Martinsen's rise to power in the Party can be traced back to his actions in the West Russian War of the 1950s. He led his military units to important victories in the chaotic struggle against the Russian advance, his temperament as cold as the snow they fought and bled upon.\n\nDespite serving the Reich as a loyal collaborator for the last two decades, Martinsen's desire for an independent Denmark has been no secret to Germania. With a successful coup cementing his Party's rule over the nation, the Fører's demands for an independent but loyal Denmark may yet come to fruition."
 POLITICS_GUSTAV_MEISSNER_DESC:0 "古斯塔夫·迈斯纳的官僚生涯刻录着他在保护国中一路升迁的历程，以及他顽强的忠诚终得回报的结果。迈斯纳曾是维尔纳·贝斯特的手下官员，而他的上司的死使他成为德国在丹麦的全权代表和实际国家元首。迈斯纳懂得察言观色和按令行事，他的政府毫无质疑地将立刻继续贝斯特的工作。"
 POLITICS_OCCUPATIONAL_AUTHORITIES_DEN_DESC:0 "随着丹麦又一次臣服于德意志的铁蹄之下，马丁·鲍曼已经下令在此成立一个临时过渡政府来稳定该地区的局势。这一政府由办事效率最高的德国官僚组成，时刻准备将权力无缝转交予下一届被元首适时选定的政府。"
 POLITICS_JENS_OTTO_KRAG_DESC:0 "在一九四零年，德国用六个小时就把丹麦化为了废墟，直到二十多年后，这里才恢复了昔日的辉煌。延斯·奥托·克拉格，就立在这曾经无比辉煌的奥兹曼迪亚斯。当其他欧洲国家在祖国母亲血肉模糊的尸体旁哭泣时，丹麦冷眼旁观，当游击队员和当地的协作者为了他们的愿景而互相残杀时，克拉格保持沉默。但他并非毫无动作。克拉格走入了社会民主党的拜占庭迷宫，决心要使普通丹麦人免受希特勒那令人作呕的意识形态的荼毒，哪怕这意味着要和国王携手并肩。\n\n跪在法老的大纪念碑前，风在背后无情地肆虐着。他知道，自己永远都回不到那种纯美的和平中去了。总有一天，他会在风沙中化为尘埃，只剩下自己成就的只只残片作为延斯·奥托·克拉格曾存在过的唯一证明。不过没关系，只要首相能带领他的人民走出沙漠，扯碎镣铐与枷锁，那么一切，从丹麦政府倒台到一九四三年设立”常务秘书“发生的一切，都将毫无意义。站起身来，克拉格注视着奥兹曼迪亚斯，眼中不是轻蔑和恐惧，而是希望的光芒。在这里，在战败的痛苦余烬之上，丹麦最伟大的胜利即将到来。"
 DEN_permanent_secretaries:0 "常务秘书内阁"
 DEN_permanent_secretaries_desc:0 "Denmark's situation is a remnant from the war. In 1943 Prime Minister Scavenius handed in his government's resignation to the King after some outrageous demands from General Hanneken. But King Christian X refused to dismiss the government, but it stood down regardless. Something had to replace the government as the executive branch, and nobody wanted German administration. Nils Svenningsen and the rest of the permanent secretaries from the ministries quickly emerged as spiritual successor to the former Government. Many found this awkward, as non elected officials were running a democratic country, with no political mandate nor legal authority, but secretary of the Interior Ministry developed the concept of 'provisional laws', laws that could be passed within a ministry, and be acted upon by bureaucrats until a parliament could ratify it. With no parliament active, and prospects for one are close to zero, Denmark has turned into a legal jungle, maneuvering around outdated provisional laws from many years ago.\n\nThe situation is more urgent than it might sound like, as Germania pressures German officials in Denmark to enact more effective measures to hasten the integration of Denmark into the Greater Germanic Reich, no one knows how long the structure will hold. May it live long, and keep Denmark away from foreign control."
 DEN_agrarian_economy:0 "农业经济"
 DEN_agrarian_economy_desc:0 "战争重创了丹麦的经济，战前无论多强的增长势头在战间全然停滞乃至陷入倒退。纵跨欧洲，非洲和俄国的征服与军事行动需要为士兵准备补给，也得为平民备置口粮。每一年，成吨的丹麦谷物被运往欧洲各地，尤其是英格兰，因为战争已经摧毁了它往日的谷物供应国。\n\n尽管丹麦经济相对稳定，陷入停滞的经济仅仅能勉强跟上德国日渐增长的需求。聪明的少男少女们被要求留在家里的农场里帮助生产，实际上则被剥夺了上大学和在城市生活的梦想。如果经济想要快速增长，那么农业改良已是势在必行。"
 DEN_threat_from_silkeborg:0 "来自锡尔克堡的威胁"
 DEN_threat_from_silkeborg_desc:0 "The Wehrmacht Garrison in Silkeborg watches closely everything that happens in Werner Best's 'Dagmarhus'. Hermann von Hanneken, is to say the least, not impressed. Best had suggested in clear text that by 1960, Denmark would be a state in the German Reich. Yet, to Hanneken's great annoyance, Best is still in place and running the show along. Every month, Hanneken sends reports, some true; some exaggerated; some fabricated, about how the resistance is still going, and how bad of a job Best is doing to deal with it. Hanneken, naturally, has ambitions for himself, seeing himself as deserving to run Denmark, it is after all, he, that has kept the peace and kept the resistance weak."

 den.4.d:0 "We have managed to thwart the recent attempt at subverting the will of our government, and the will of our people! Foolish and vain, our heroic soldiers patrolling the capital made quick work of the perpetrators, and now they await their trial. However, despite this clear showing of strength and organization, we have a major problem that is now facing us. The Führer of the Reich, Albert Speer, leader of a Germany bound to fall into degeneracy and trappings of \"democracy\", has demanded that we are to immediately release the treasoners that we have taken to trial, and that we enter into the Einheitspakt. Though we could deny as a showing of ideological purity and continue with the trial, which would conclude with their mass execution, we also have to consider the legitimacy of their threats. We may see the Führer as a spineless betrayer of National Socialism, but with the possibility of the Wehrmacht bearing down on our borders, we may be strong-armed into joining the Reich so that we do not lose our sovereignty.\n\nRegardless of what we may think, we must make a decision with all due haste."
