 GUC_Angelo_Almeida: "安热洛·诺拉斯科·德·阿尔梅达"
 POLITICS_Angelo_Nolasco_de_Almeida_DESC: "在为巴西海军服役的漫长生涯里，安热洛·诺拉斯科·德·阿尔梅达海军上将曾担任过许多大名鼎鼎的职务，但他从来没想过自己会成为盟军占领圭亚那-卡宴的军事长官。他在“新国家”时代的种种行动，尤其是在1932年对护宪革命的镇压，使得他与热图利奥·瓦加斯之间的关系更加紧密，瓦加斯也因此在1939年任命他为自己的副官。大战期间，他曾出任巴西驻阿根廷及乌拉圭大使馆的武官，后来参与到巴西占领圭亚那-卡宴的入侵行动之中。\n\n瓦加斯政权倒台后，阿尔梅达在海军出任过诸多管理职位，始终都与三军力量中的护宪派步调一致。1961年，洛特总统将领导卡宴政府的重任交给了这位海军上将。自大战结束以来，这块前法国殖民地的管理工作始终步履维艰，巴西已经退出了同盟国，美国则坚持要保留这里，作为与未来的法国盟友讨价还价的筹码。\n\n然而，这不是洛特想要的。总统责令诺拉斯科·德·阿尔梅达海军上将，将卡宴经济整合进巴西之中，鼓励移民，创造新的就业岗位。海军上将毕生都在为巴西服务，他将竭尽所能，完成这个任务。"

 GUC_International_Ambiguity: "法国遗产"
 GUC_International_Ambiguity_desc: "卡宴曾长期被法国作为流放罪犯的殖民地，由此产生的遗留问题至今仍然有着不小的影响。由于大量法国流亡族群的存在，他们与原住民、还有巴西占领军之间的冲突时有发生。\n\n二战的最后几天，巴西军队打进卡宴，由此奠定了这一地区现今的格局：盟军占领圭亚那-卡宴由巴西政府及其军队管理，同时拥有美国给予的外交支持。然而，美国希望维持托管领模棱两可的国际地位，避免激怒法兰西国或是自由法国中潜在的经济伙伴。现如今，维希政府被德国所束缚，戴高乐政权则深陷非洲纠葛的泥潭，巴西将卡宴整合进其经济体系中的目标已经占了上风。"
 GUC_Brazilian_Immigration: "巴西移民"
 GUC_Brazilian_Immigration_desc: "虽然巴西与法属圭亚那之间的移民从未中断，但自洛特于1960年开始推行其一体化政策时起，移民数量急剧增长。为实现洛特总统的目标，安热洛·诺拉斯科·德·阿尔梅达总督鼓励创造了大量就业机会，移民浪潮随之而来。这样的移民活动给当地的人口结构带来了变化，巴西人在圭亚那一卡宴已经成为了相当庞大的少数民族，他们与法国人和克里奥尔人之间绝非相安无事。"

 GUC_Pauxy_Gentil_Nunes_hog_desc: "A sportsman in his youth, Pauxy Nunes entered politics at the behest of his brother Janary, the first governor of the territory of Amapá. After serving one term as governor from 1958 to 1961, he received an invitation by Admiral Nolasco de Almeida to head the Cayenne Administration's civilian government.\n\nDespite being a member of the PSP, Nunes has pledged to work towards Lott's goal, seeing the economic integration as a boon to his neighboring territory of Amapá. Nunes has fostered the creation of agricultural colonies and model farms in Guiana-Cayenne, advancing the region's food production."
 GUC_Luis_Mendes_da_Silva_eco_desc: "A military man, Luis Mendes da Silva has been selected by Admiral Nolasco de Almeida to lead the process of the economic integration of Cayenne. Mendes da Silva has been tasked with overseeing the building of highways to connect Cayenne and the territory of Amapá, furthering the economic ties and easing migration.\n\nWhile Mendes da Silva has connections to Castelo Branco and the Sorbonne faction of the Armed Forces, he is ready to work towards Lott's goal of integration, even if this means collaborating with the local French elites."
 GUC_Helio_Pennafort_for_desc: "Hélio Pennafort has dedicated his life to his career. A journalist, writer, and radio personality, Pennafort was a political commentator in Amapá and a major figure in the territory's media and culture.\n\nWhile his appointment to the government of the Allied Administration of Guiana-Cayenne came as a surprise to some, to him it is merely a way to make the people's voice heard and to properly communicate with the Brazilian government, and ensure that Cayenne gets whatever resources it needs. So far, he has done an effective job."
 GUC_Fernando_Belfort_Bethlem_sec_desc: "Fernando Belfort Bethlem has a thankless job.\n\nEntering the Military in 1932 he went on to become an aspiring and rapid rising Cavalry officer before the war. Promoted to Captain during ww2 he went with the Brazilian Expeditionary force to Britain. Fighting with Henrique Lott against the Germany tides and despite their defeat, Fernando for his valour received further promotions. Throughout the 50s Fernando continued to gain new titles before in 1961 being promoted to General by Henrique Lottm where he was immediatly deployed to Cayenne the death of all Brazilian generals careers.\n\nNow in Cayenne Fernando struggles to keep order with the limited cavalry troops he has, having to use the Brazilian garrison to stop clashes between the native French, Creole and immigrant Brazilian populations. While Fernando has kept order so far and lasted longer than some other generals in his role, he worries that one day there will be a battle too big for him and his limited garrison to win."
