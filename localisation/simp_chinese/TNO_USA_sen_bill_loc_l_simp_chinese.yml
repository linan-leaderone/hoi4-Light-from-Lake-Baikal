 USA_sen_bill_desc_3:0 "本内特政府已经受够了美国过时已久的经济政策所导致的经济停滞和下滑。因此，是时候把美国从现行的银本位转向更为盈利的制度——金本位了。如果我们能够成功在国会两院通过这一议案，那么我们就能通过改善的金融体系来团结国家了。"
 USA_sen_bill.3.t:0 "白银法案面临国会激战"
 USA_sen_bill.3.d:0 "本内特政府一直在不遗余力地仔细审查《白银法案》。为了将其最终定案，总统与白宫西厢办公室的一众高级官员进行了通力合作。福特副总统声称，该法案是“本内特政府救助美国经济的最优先计划之一”。\n\n本内特亲自挂帅，以敦促民主党人行动起来支持他的计划。通过将货币支持的贵金属转化为黄金，美国经济的步伐将更加稳健，因为黄金作为一种储藏手段现在比工业银可靠得多。《白银法案》最重要的内容之一，莫过于废除1934年通过的《白银购买法案》。据财政部长阿布萨隆·罗伯逊所说，该法案将回调对银矿开采的聚焦，并“强化政府内部的财政责任”。\n\n尽管法案在国会内部似乎受到青睐，亦不乏有人试图让其胎死腹中。许多被建制派遗弃的南方民主党人——他们现在已经转投至国家进步公约国民党团旗下——态度反感，认为现有的银矿工人将因此遭受损害。无独有偶，国家进步公约进步党团也表明了他们的反对立场，声称该法案有害于美国的就业——这倒是像极了两派结成的畸形联盟。《白银法案》究竟能否在国会的斗争中幸存下来，我们只有拭目以待。"
 USA_sen_bill.3.a:0 "国会将决定我们的命运。"
 bill_3_passed:0 "当日早间，政治分析人士就已聚集在华盛顿国会大厦前的台阶上等待着最新消息。他们报道称，本内特政府带头起草的白银法案经由多次讨论、研究与协商，最终顺利通过参众两院表决，被正式签署为法律。过去几个月中，白宫西翼、财政部以及华盛顿特区以外的顾问和官员们为编制白银法案不辞辛劳地工作，法案的通过证明了他们拥有着巨大的潜力。\n\n本内特总统当晚就法案通过国会发表了评论，他宣称这是“彰显美利坚合众国团结和潜能的瞩目成就，是迈向经济繁荣新时代的一大步。”本内特政府的多位人士均对总统热情的讲话表示赞同，财政部长阿布萨隆·罗伯逊认为，“银本位导致美国的金融体系无法跟上时代，我们将会通过金本位在世界范围内展示美国的经济实力。”共和党与民主党互相赞许对方为实现法案通过的共同目标而展开的党派合作。\n\n另一边，国家进步公约的参众议员对白银法案表决结果的态度相对冷淡。虽然有一些议员和共民联盟一同庆贺法案的成功，另一些则因为法案如此轻易地通过国会而深感困惑。但至少就目前而言，美国迈出了以黄金支持美元的第一步。"

 USA_sen_bill_name_6:0 "联邦教育援助法案"
 USA_sen_bill_desc_6:0 "教育在美国建国之初就是一大问题，学校自行管理收支而州给予大致的教育方向。这意味着教学质量根据所在地区的贫富程度有所不同，也就是说许多学生并没有受到足以为未来做好准备的教育。《联邦教育援助法案》将会通过给予那些急需援助的州援助并且设立联邦教育的标准以解决这个问题。"
 bill_6_passed:0 "距离白宫仅仅几个街区之隔的华盛顿特区斯特朗·约翰·汤姆森小学中，被师生团团簇拥的罗伯特·肯尼迪总统签署了联邦教育援助法案，摄影师们用新闻摄像机为美国人民的子孙后代郑重记录下了这极具历史性的一幕。\n\n“今天，我们说，所有美国学生都应该有机会学习和成长，成为见多识广、聪明伶俐的新一代青年，他们将会把美国建设得比以往任何时候都更加完满。医生、教师、艺术家、发明家和未来的领袖们今天就在我们的学校里。当下，我们必须尽己所能，缔造更美好的明天。”\n\n《联邦教育援助法案》将针对美国中小学的数学、英语、历史、科学、公民教育等学科设立新的底线标准。同时，联邦政府将会资助那些苦于财政原因无法在雇佣教师、扩大教室等方面达到新标准的州和学校董事会，以此促进全国的教育平等。该法案还包括资助更新式、更安全的校车，处罚未能结束学校隔离的学区，以及建立一个无党派委员会负责在全国范围内对教科书实行标准化。\n\n教育团体和民权组织对《联邦教育援助法案》包含的平等和标准化条款感到十分满意，但这一法案激怒了众多州权拥趸，因为它几乎剥夺了地方对教育的控制权，而教育事务权向来是各州最为重要的职能之一。虽然法案的大部分条款仅适用于那些需要资助并“自愿接受”的学区，但许多亟需资金的贫困州学区为了维持运营，势必在理念问题上被迫作出妥协。即便如此，《联邦教育援助法案》很快就会让美国成为世界上教育最发达的国家之一。"
 bill_6_failed:0 "令人震惊的是，《联邦教育援助法案》未能通过参议院表决。负责监督投票的副总统休伯特·汉弗莱宣布，该法案没有获得足额票数，他和肯尼迪总统为推动学校改革而作出的努力因此遭受沉重打击。\n\n“改革美国学校尝试的失败必将贻害千年，”鲍比·肯尼迪在一次新闻发布会上愤怒地说道。“下一位乔治·华盛顿·卡佛痛失了发掘自己潜能的机会，下一位欧内斯特·海明威只会在贫困中泯然于众人，下一位托马斯·爱迪生永远也无法改变世界了。”\n\n《联邦教育援助法案》将针对美国中小学的数学、英语、历史、科学、公民教育等学科设立新的底线标准。同时，联邦政府将会资助那些苦于财政原因无法在雇佣教师、扩大教室等方面达到新标准的州和学校董事会，以此促进全国的教育平等。该法案还包括资助更新式、更安全的校车，处罚未能结束学校隔离的学区，以及建立一个无党派委员会负责在全国范围内对教科书实行标准化。\n\n在州权拥趸看来，这项以促进美国教育平等化为目标的法案是“严苛”且“暴虐”的联邦侵犯，他们为这起图谋的破产而欢呼。民权团体和教育联盟就法案失败深表遗憾，并谴责了教育领域中存在的诸多不平等现象——而消灭这种不平等的希望如今也已破灭。"

 USA_sen_bill_name_7:0 "平价住房法案"
 USA_sen_bill_desc_7:0 "美国梦的核心一直都是一件事：拥有自己的住房。但自二战结束以来，房地产开发商变得专注于服务中产阶级城郊居民：在远离大都会市中心的蜿蜒小巷中建设数以千计雷同的房舍。这使得数百万人，尤其是少数族裔，被挤出了住宅市场。《平价住房法案》将解决该问题，其将主导修建大量新房屋与基础设施，以供新社区的形成。"
 bill_7_passed:0 "法案签署仪式的直播将在白宫椭圆形办公室举行，摄影师的闪光灯不停闪烁着。在罗伯特·肯尼迪总统正式签署《平价租房法案》成为法律后，美国各地大小城市的房地产开发商、民权领袖和市长纷纷为之鼓掌。\n\n总统在签署该法案前感慨道：“我很高兴能让这项议案成为法律，这将使那些以前只能梦想拥有住房的美国人更容易建造负担得起，宜居且安全的住房。今天，我们敢保证，美国的每个家庭都有权拥有自己的一方屋檐。”\n\n新法律将允许将城市内许多地区重新规划为建筑密度更高的住宅区，以鼓励房地产商在房价过高的地区之外开发新建筑，并向购房者提供低息贷款。该法案还将为建筑商开发公园和购物中心等公共区域提供补贴，并帮助建立从这些新开发项目到城市核心区的公共交通路线。这些新住宅不会像一些反对者建议的那样是公寓楼，而是复式公寓、联排公寓、行列式公寓和其他类似的建筑，以便让更多的人能够获得住房，而那些更大的、以汽车为主的郊区住宅对于少数族裔来说过于昂贵，甚至是被禁止购入的，政府为开发商提供资金的条件是，不为非裔美国人、亚裔美国人、拉美裔美国人或其他任何人设置任何购买障碍。\n\n在全国的各个城市，建设“肯尼迪之家”的计划已经制定完成，多年来被忽视和遗弃的地区将会重新开发，并推动持续十年或更长时间的新建设热潮。"
 bill_7_failed:0 "计票完毕，《平价租房法案》被参议院否决，而这本应是罗伯特·肯尼迪总统之后各项议程的基石。国会里对支出的抱怨、对投资流向的质疑，甚至阴魂不散的种族隔离言论都阻挠了这项法案的通过，随之而去的是大城市复兴的希望和少数民族以及工薪阶层对住房的简单愿望，让总统构建新一批有产者的计划付诸东流。\n\n“总统对参议院拒绝通过《平价租房法案》一事深感失望，”一位白宫发言人在一次媒体见面会上表示，“但是，扩大房屋所有权的斗争不会停止，我们将继续致力于让每个美国人有机会买一套自己的房子，而不仅仅让那些富豪和中产囤货居奇。”\n\n这项失败的法律本有机会让全国城市有机会将大片无用土地转为高密度居民区，进而带动高房价地区新住宅的建设，降低房价。此外，购买者提供小额贷款。法案本还能为公共设施提供补助，包括建立新公园和购物中心，并附带建立从这些新居民区到达中心城区的大型通勤线路。这些新家不会是反对党所嘲讽的公寓楼，而会是复式、套房、连栋等让人民有机会体验那些因价格或歧视将少数族裔拒之门外的郊区别墅居住体验的建筑——因为政府投资并不是无条件的，而是要求房产商保证不对非裔、亚裔、拉丁裔，或任何少数族裔设置任何购买障碍。\n\n但是，被亲切称为“肯尼迪堡”的房屋建筑计划必须暂时束之高阁了，而数以百万计的美国人将继续忍受租住差强人意破旧不堪的公寓与廉租房。"

Once there, however, it stalled, died, and left millions of poor Americans without hope for government aid.\n\nThe loss of the bill in the Senate has definitely weakened the position of the President Margaret Chase Smith, as well as humiliated the extremely vocal supporters of it found in Senator Harrington and Governor Wallace.

 bill_30_passed:0 "In what is sure to be a landmark moment for President Goldwater's administration, the proposed budget has been accepted by both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Initially highly unpopular and still polarising even now, extensive lobbying has managed to secure the support necessary for the bill being passed.\n\nThe bill, which includes the slashing of welfare and social security budgets, has paved the way for the President's broader economic and fiscal agenda. While it is uncertain how this budgetary reorientation is going to impact the American economy in the long run, analysts have been cautiously optimistic. The Goldwater administration meanwhile, is overjoyed at this major political victory. It is likely the administration will want to capitalise on the momentum the passing of the budget has generated, and more proposals are expected to follow.\n\nAs could have been expected however, the adoption of the budget has unfortunately widened the divisions within the Republicans-Democrats. Many Republicans have expressed their deep opposition to the President's fiscal agenda. Consequently, many of them now feel tempted to flock into the welcoming and eager arms of the Progressive NPP. How this will affect the stability of the coalition will remain to be seen.\n\nNevertheless, it is a major victory for the White House and Secretary Don Regan in particular, whose fiscal philosophy, dubbed \"Reganomics\", has been the cornerstone of the bill. This victory is a momentous occasion which is undoubtedly to lead to the popping of champagne bottles in the oval office. Certainly, the President can sleep a little easier knowing this battle has been won."

It now seems however, that these efforts were to no avail, as the bill lies dead on the floor of congress.\n\nWith the rejection of the President's budget, the flagship of the White House's economic and fiscal agenda has been sunk. Weeks of hard work have been undone in a single stroke and it seems ever more uncertain if President Goldwater will be able to push the other elements of his fiscal and economic agenda through congress. For now, the new administration's efforts have been stopped dead in their tracks. Reportedly the cabinet is currently convening in a room in the West Wing on how to proceed from here on out. Secretary Don Regan, whose fiscal philosophy has been a central component of the bill, seems particularly infuriated at the news of the bill's defeat.\n\nOpponents of the bill have been overjoyed however, with the Republican half of the Republicans-Democrats having found cause to celebrate. How this will affect the Democrats' position is uncertain, although this legislative defeat has certainly shown their weakness. In any case, it is a serious blow to the President's agenda.

Years of debate have concluded with a step forward in offering some political protections for African-Americans. President Bennett declared that the Voting Rights Act \"stands as a long-overdue step to address one of the most bitter injustices in American history.\"\n\nWhile the administration regards the passage of the bill as a rousing success, African-Americans across the country reported mixed emotions over the bill. As one African-American woman in Atlanta related, \" President Bennett's taken a larger step forward than anyone else regarding civil rights, but we've all been here before, with empty words and nothing to show for it.\"\n\nMany in the nation, however, are relieved with President Bennett's success, figuring that if more issues arise, they can be handled in due time. This sentiment, however, is not shared by the RDC's Southern Democrats and the Nationalist branch of the NPP. With this latest act, the Southern Democrats are likely to tilt further to the Nationalists on concerns over federal overreach."

We've been trying to win our protections and rights for so long - and nobody ever listens.\"\n\nMeanwhile, across the South and beyond, Democrats and Nationalists in the NPP have declared the failure of the Voting Rights Act to be a unmitigated success. Southern Democrats have lined up before the media to crow about their \"pride in the protection of our states' rights,\" while Southern Nationalist congressmen went further in declaring that \"the federal government ought to learn it needs to mind its own damned business!\""

President Bennett, a typically conservative Democrat, publicly spoke on the bill's passing alongside Vice President Ford, stating that the \"time has come for African-Americans within our country to receive fair and just treatment, as the rest of our countrymen enjoy.\"\n\nAfrican-Americans across the country celebrate the passage of the Voting Rights Act, with many crediting the Republican legislators who raised awareness over the shortcomings of the original draft, which only sought to provide protections from voting irregularities rather than dismantling segregationist policies more thoroughly. For African-Americans, the President and his administration are a rare light of hope in a Democratic Party that has more often sided with the status quo, with one man praising the President for \"stepping past his political leanings to serve the people.\"\n\nHowever, many Southern Democrats have publicly criticized the bill for \"overstepping the States' rights to make decisions for themselves.\" Furthermore, the Nationalist branch of the NPP has sided with the Southern Democrats, claiming that the law is \"an act of tyranny by the federal Government.\" It is left in the hands of the executive branch to implement and ensure that the Voting Rights Act can fulfill its promise for African-Americans."

One Southern Democrat stated that \"the extreme measures of the Voting Rights Act far exceeded what the Federal Government can decide in regards to States' rights.\" Southern leaders in the Nationalist Caucus were less circumspect, with one politician declaring that \"segregation is here to remain in the United States, whether the Republicans like it or not!\""

Even back in November, when the Associated Press announced her victory and the NPP headquarters exploded in a hurricane of cheers and hoorays, she left the party as soon as the cameras turned off, returning to her office to put some finishing touches on her foreign policy concept.\n\nBut today, Smith decided to celebrate. It was nothing massive, of course - a mere flute of champagne before today's stack of paperwork - but the gesture itself was all that mattered. After decades of work, of politics, of endless traveling across the American continent, she finally accomplished something monumental. People rarely feel the effects of whatever goes on in Washington, but this bill was sure to fundamentally change the lives of millions of Americans for the better. Her campaign was all about Japan and Germany, but Smith herself never forgot about the nation that mattered the most - America.\n\nMargaret took one last sip of champagne before returning to her duties. It was remarkably sweet, a taste that reminded her of her younger years, back when she was nothing but an office worker at Daniel E. Cummings Woolen Company and had enough time for a regular social life, enough time to go out with her friends or have friends at all. Sometimes, she missed these times - but days like this one reminded her that giving it all up has been very much worth it.\n\nShe put her glass aside and went back to work.

In this desire for the care of servicemen, the LeMay administration managed to construct the greatest expansion of the G.I.

Eventually, as the dust settles, LeMay finds pride in his success through the Senate, as the chapters stand approved.\n\nPresident Curtis LeMay, in an act of self-satisfaction and pride of his country, stands as one of the most happy in the eventual passage of the bill. Having been harassed regarding the needs of African-American veterans, and the overall need of veterans as a whole, President LeMay has used the opportunity to throw together several celebrations alongside figures in the military high command as well as veterans throughout the countries. \"Though I appear to you as Commander-in-Chief, know that it is I who seeks to serve you, now, after all your years of service.\"\n\nHowever, as all things within the span of the Wallace and LeMay presidencies, nothing can stand without the potential rise of controversy in its wake. In particular, Progressives throughout the country have criticized the Nationalists' focus on veteran social standing when all of the country has been put through economic hardships, some of which they say \"comes from the Nationalists' insessance of a free market.\" One group of Republican protesters in Washington D.C. continued to shout \"They fight, we fight, we all fight!\" while waving around banners depicting X's over the President's face."

President Curtis LeMay, a man known for his service to his country above all other political schemes, worked towards the expansion of the G.I. Bill to grow benefits towards veterans of the Second World War, as well as several chapters working to include African-American servicemen into such benefits. However, despite the dedication to their country, the Senate refused to agree upon the bill, and thus left it as a failure.\n\nThe administration alongside President Curtis LeMay can be, in witnessing the Senate's refusal to sign the chapters of expansion towards the G.I. Bill, appalled. Appalled over the failure to pass such a bill. Appalled to learn of the failure of the country to its veterans. Appalled in seeing the thousands of veterans out there who suffer, day in, and day out, hurt by political scheming taking precedence over humanity. \"How could anyone call themselves a patriot in acknowledging that they have destroyed simple aid towards those who gave themselves over to fight the Nazis, to fight the Japanese, to fight tyranny and despots themselves?\" President LeMay said, regarding the failure.\n\nHowever, despite the shaming remarks lashed out by the President, many stand proud of their defiance of the Nationalists. In particular, many sects of Progressive wings sought to stand against President LeMay and the administration inside the White House, claiming that the President's actions had only been an opening into furthering Wallace's Nationalist ideals. \"LeMay doesn't know what he's doing out there, and yeah, maybe he wants to look good for all those who served their country.

The constant fights have exhausted Americans throughout the country, with the clashing coming to a head as the military has come under fire for being regarded as racially segregated and, thus, without justice to all Americans. President LeMay, refusing to allow a military without prosperity, brought together his administration to produce the National Armed Forces Freedom Act, establishing quotas for African-American prominence in military units, which has found outstanding success in the Senate and shall be signed into law.\n\nOnce more, the Presidency of Curtis LeMay, whether concerned over the needs of the Nationalists and the National Progressive Pact or not, has issued a new sweeping reform of the Armed Forces in the United States, pleasing both himself as Commander-in-Chief and the hardlining military staff within the administration and beyond. Throughout the country, African-American veterans of the Second World War have gathered, some back into their old military units, to celebrate President LeMay's long-needed reforms. \"We fought just as hard as any white soldier did, whether they were in the Pacific, or out there on top of machine guns in England.

But mark my words in knowing that I have fought dearly for you, the young Americans who seek to serve their strong, godly country.\" African-American veterans of the Second World War protested the acts of the Senate, having organized marches upon the steps of Washington D.C.\n\nDespite the lengthy efforts of the President and his administration in working towards the progressiveness of the United States military, some remain silently proud regarding the Nationalists' senatorial failure. Many groups have claimed several statements regarding their support of African-Americans looking to serve their country, but their outright refusal in bending towards the desires of the Nationalists. \"All LeMay wanted was to look nice so that he could put in the next big Nationalist hammer of oppression.

There were a handful of civil rights activists, still in shock that \"Bombs Away LeMay\" had somehow pushed a real civil rights bill through Congress. At the center of it all, was her husband, smiling broadly and looking ridiculous sitting in front of a tiny bill-signing table. Clinging to him were dozens of Black little boys and girls.\n\nHelen smiled as Curtis pulled a small kindergartener in a suit onto his lap and handed him one of his pens, which the boy immediately put into his mouth. The children, students at the Thaddeus Stevens School in Washington, had been her idea. Curtis had always been fond of children and always been willing to open up to them in a way he didn't with other people. She'd passed the idea along to some member of his staff as a way to get him to be less stiff, to be more human. When people looked at her husband, she wanted them to see more than a cigar-chomping caricature. She wanted them to see a man ready to serve as President for all Americans.\n\nOf course, there were people who wouldn't like that. It seemed that every letter thanking Curtis came paired with a death threat. Just the other day, police had stopped a man at the Capitol with a bomb strapped to his chest. The day before, some raving fascist had tried to climb over the White House's wrought-iron fence. On television were images of celebrating Black Americans and dark rallies attended by growing throngs of discontented whites. At the head of them was a pale, thin man warning of the threat of \"miscegenation and liberalism\" and vowing to stop it at all cost.\n\nBut for now, Helen pushed these thoughts from her mind. There would be a time to worry about the future. For now, she wanted to celebrate what her husband had achieved, to acknowledge the countless lives that would be transformed by his hard work. As a girl hugged Curtis and he erupted into laughter, Helen stepped into the Rose Garden and into the brilliant day."

When Wallace had come to her husband and asked him to join his ticket, Helen had begged and pleaded with her husband to reject the offer. It would destroy him, she said, transform him from a hero to a bum.\n\nNow, years later, she found herself sitting numbly in the White House residence, hands clasped together, waiting for her husband after the failure of his civil rights act. On the television there were pictures of rioters spreading across the country, of laughing segregationists, of some smirking communist speaking to a crowd in Minneapolis. The one thing that united them all was a burning hatred of her husband. It was not just that he had betrayed Wallace but that he had failed, that he had once again proven that no man escapes from the morass of Washington.\n\nHelen heard the click of an open door behind her. She turned to see her husband. There was no anger in his face, no sign of the clever, cigar-chomping character invented by the newspapers. The Curtis LeMay she saw looked gaunt and hollow, his face empty of all hope. The only time she had ever seen him look like this was when he came home after the War, when they sat in her mother's little kitchen in Cleveland and he told her in a deadened voice of all the cruelty he had inflicted.

If passed, it could satisfy Wallace's one-time allies in Congress and allow LeMay to propose other changes to American society."

The bill had died a slow death in the Senate, harming President Johnson's reputation among his progressive allies while galvanizing every true American patriot against his nonsense ideas.

He had been at a meeting of the Youngstown Democrats the night before and was still a little sleepy from the late night. The news of the law's passage rattled around in his mind as he began the commute to work. Doubt bubbled up in his stomach, leaving him sweaty and queasy.\n\nWas passing this law really the best idea? Sure, Blacks should be able to vote, and the Southerners' treatment of them from what he saw on TV was bad, but what did that have to do with Mark Brown? Why wouldn't he be able to sell his house to whomever he damn well-pleased? He pulled the car into his spot at work and paused for a moment.\n\nAcross the street was a home with a for sale sign. A black couple, the man in a suit, the woman looking around nervously, approached the home.

Johnson had been confident, clearly overly so, that his patented treatment would be sufficient to get the law over the finish line.

Previously Social Security only covered the elderly, those over the age of 65. With the expansion however, the disabled of America will now be covered by Social Security.\n\nDue to their disabilities, many of these people are unable to work and live in poverty, suffering at the margins of society. No more, thanks to President Johnson's bill. Thanks to a combination of hikes to income and payroll taxes, Social Security will vastly expand its reach, alleviate poverty, and still remain solvent. Many conservative critics had alleged that the program would ruin the Federal government's finances but thus far the books seem to be balancing.\n\nThe bill's passage is another triumph for President Johnson, the aid to the disabled representing another plank in his platform for a Great Society. The new Social Security payments represent a new salvo in the War on Poverty and President Johnson does not mean to call off the attack until his opponent has been obliterated."

Progressives and liberals are, more than disappointed, genuinely angry with the Johnson White House.

With new regulations of health insurance companies and subsidies, many Americans previously denied coverage or facing massive medical bills for needed surgery will finally have options. Insurance companies will no longer be able to charge patients with pre-existing conditions different rates than other consumers, nor will they be able to deny them coverage. Further federal regulations aim at suppressing rising healthcare costs to protect consumers.\n\nThe bill's positive effects became clear almost immediately. One good example was a construction worker named Vito Corelli. A few years ago on a job his hand had been injured in an accident. While he'd avoided amputation, nerve damage rendered it nearly useless. Any doctors who had taken a look had quoted him such an eye-popping sum that he had nearly fainted. After the new Workplace Healthcare Act provisions kicked in, he had the surgery done for a single $300 co-pay. With a few weeks of rest and plenty of physical therapy he was back to coaching his sons' little league teams again.\n\nStories like that multiplied across the country, Americans finally getting the healthcare they needed. Each healed person, rendered whole again, knew that they had President Johnson to thank. No society could be great until sickness had been eradicated and this new law goes some distance to achieving that goal."

We're in a coalition with people who see no role for the federal government on this issue, none, that we shouldn't prevent discrimination by healthcare companies. What a world! What a party!\"\n\nThe bill's failure bodes poorly for the remainder of President Johnson's agenda.

While facing strong opposition from conservatives, both in the RDC and the NPP, the bill survived and will now reshape the entire country for the better.\n\nThe act establishes two programs, Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare is available to elderly citizens and is paid for via a broad-based payroll tax. It covers a variety of healthcare costs, including long-term care through reimbursements to providers. Medicaid is a program operated jointly with participating states that offers a huge breadth of reimbursements for healthcare services but only covers the \"categorical poor\". That is to say, only those poor who are working, or pregnant, or elderly, or if their family is of a particular size.\n\nWhile a massive step forward for America, the bill does have flaws. Some Americans remain without health insurance, with calamitous health outcomes potentially arising for many while for others the healthcare they do receive is either of poor quality due to a lower reimbursement rate compared to private insurance, or still too extensive. If the Johnson administration is going to build a truly Great Society, they must follow this victory with another."

 FR_NPP_compromise_desc_30:0 "Inside the \"fish room\" in the west wing, two men sat opposite each other. On one side, President Barry Morris Goldwater. Opposite of him, Senator Richard Russell Jr., representing his faction of the NPP.\n\n\"Mister President-\" Russell began. \"-I've looked at your bill in detail, and I am convinced it can be salvaged.\" Goldwater knew exactly what \"salvaged\" meant here. He had no illusions who he was dealing with, and what sort of price Russell would ask in exchange for cooperation. It was why the President had invited him here today, hoping that Russel's demands wouldn't be too outrageous. On the other side of the table Senator Russell looked at him with appraising eyes. The Georgian senator too, knew perfectly well who he was dealing with. Goldwater was many things, but committed on the issue of civil rights he was not. Russell was well aware of the President's ambivalence on the matter. Such ambivalence might be an opening for Russel's own political agenda, so he thought to himself. If the President was willing to budge here, Russell would be able to budge on the topic of finance.\n\n\"It seems to us that your budget proposal entails a significant reduction in spending, freeing up a significant amount of federal funds.\" the President could already guess where Russell was going with this. \"Perhaps it is time some of these funds made their way back to the south.'\" Russell leaned forward on the table, closing the physical distance between him and the President. \"We'd be willing to lend you the votes you need, Mr. President.\" \"If room can be made in the bill to send some of the available funds to Southern schools.\"\n\nRussell paused briefly.\n\n\"White schools, naturally.\""
