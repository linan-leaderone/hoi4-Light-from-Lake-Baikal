Shifting the focus away from segregation and states' rights and towards populist measures and cooperation with other free nations in the world, George Wallace ended up being a controversial but rather mild-measured politician, something that however didn't keep him from being impeached. While some Americans ended up becoming more radical, if only because of Wallace's flaming rhetoric and grand campaign promises, most of his supporters ended up defecting to the RDC, as the NPP's image as a serious political party has taken a serious blow following the impeachment of its elected first President.\n\nNow, Curtis LeMay stands as the leader of the Free World after Wallace's controversial removal from office.

 USA_promise_what_they_want_desc:0 "言语不要钱，所以我们可以最大限度地去利用这种免费武器。进步党团是我们背靠着的一只固执猴子，但也许只要我们像乌鸦一样一直在他们耳边念叨着融合主义，一定能哄骗他们来支持我们的提议的。\n\n李梅将会专注于与进步党团的对话。他会告诉他们自己当然支持种族平等与融合，但是，承诺也不能作的太过，否则便会遭到国民党团的反噬。无论最后能做到的有多少，他都会承诺推行种族融合。这应该多少能安抚下那些进步党人了。"
 USA_allies_across_the_aisle_desc:0 "华莱士也许有赢得64年大选的超凡魅力，但他被弹劾下台这一事却暴露出一个事实：妥协永远无法成为政客坚实的盔甲。但李梅却看到了华莱士曾经视而不见的机会，那就是那些保守的共和党人，他们要比民主党人更能与南方共情。\n\n李梅将会与保守派冉冉升起的政治新星巴里·戈德华特对话以打开共和党人的大门。总统会证明他们之间的一致多于分歧，并会展露出与保守共和党合作以构造其美国政治强大保守体系的意愿。当然，戈德华特在民权问题上的态度显然更加灵活，但这就是妥协存在的意义，不是吗？"
 USA_revanchist_rhetoric_desc:0 "就算到了世界末日，面对复仇主义时，NPP成员仍然会欣然点头。我们在一个共同的愿景下团结一致，携手奋进。这个愿景就是无论如何艰难，都要从日本佬手中将我们的条约港和夏威夷都夺回来！\n\n我们将会通过强调复仇主义来将党派团结起来。共民联盟只是一群扭捏作态的胆小鬼，他们绝无胆量与日本佬一绝生死。这样，进步党团也许就能放下我们在民权问题上的分歧。而“烧烤大师”李梅将会给让东京方面颤抖于美国的淫威之下，并为二战中的一切不公复仇！"
 USA_like_wallace_never_left_desc:0 "不管怎么说，人民是把票投给华莱士的，而不是李梅。华莱士主义根据人民的价值倾向灵活出台社会政策，而李梅尽管个人不敢对此苟同，但仍得牢牢遵从。只有这样，南方佬才能安下心来，才能相信他是站在保护他们的传统生活方式与自由的一方的。\n\n李梅将会捍卫华莱士的遗产。华莱士是个好人，他闪光的一面无法被几个错误所掩盖。李梅总统曾经是他的副总统，而南方选民一定会为他长期支持华莱士的草根革命以反抗联邦暴政感到骄傲！"
 USA_select_integration_desc:0 "李梅已经对过够多的话了，是时候该起来走动走动了。他将要小心翼翼的在共民联盟与进步党团间走上钢丝，同时也要向南方民主党和国民党团保证自己的所作所为不会触及他们的地方政策。\n\n总统将会罕见地起草一份有限融合法案。学校将会被“去隔离化”，但并不会强制整合先前设立的黑人与白人校区。而公司也会在拥有者获得违反服务条款豁免权利的条件下“有限整合”。当然，所有人都有资格慢慢适应这种改变。你绝不能突然将这种激烈的改革强制推向南方，数年前，肯尼迪就是犯下了这样的错误，才导致了华莱士的当选。"
 USA_exempt_private_schools_desc:0 "为什么那些自由主义者就这么不明事理呢？私立学校又不是我们出资建的，他们爱招谁就招谁，可与我们无关。按照他们这样说，难道我们要去叫哈佛大学给路边的每一个乞丐都发一本录取通知书吗？明眼人都知道这根本不可能，联邦有什么权力去要求那些白人私立学校录取黑人学生以扭曲他们本就敏感的贵族教育呢？\n\n李梅总统将会为那些私立学校大开后门，允许他们保留“种族隔离”并避开融合政策。这样，那些钱主就能放心的把孩子送进那些私立学校了。而且如果某些学校本身由于学生的种族问题而拒绝录取，那就是他们自己的问题了。政府双手干干净净，白白亮亮。"
 USA_yearly_integration_quotas_desc:0 "进步党团小狗们看到这块骨头一定得发了疯地嗷嗷叫的。我们要告诉他们，“我们当然会推行种族融合，你看，我们甚至出台规定融合指标的政策呢！”我们会给他们画个大饼，但关键则在于细节。我们当然会有指标，这点我们说到做到，但这指标量将会被尽可能地压缩，甚至小得可怜，而那些南方平民甚至不会发现任何区别。\n\n我们将会出台一份年度融合指标的政策，具体多少呢？小得你都看不到，进步党团愿意妥协多少我们就降多少。我们当然会进行融合，慢了点又怎么样？这么做，既能让进步党团满意，又能让国民党团保持对我们的信任。"
 USA_service_for_service_desc:0 "在他的总统生涯中，李梅不知道自己在办公室门前下定了多少次坚持信念的决心，他绝不会逾越他的最后底线：允许种族隔离制度在军队中扎根，这会严重影响军队的行动效率，为此，他甚至不惜捍卫军队中的种族融合。\n\n李梅将会在军队内部推动种族融合并把非裔美国人加入军队这件事捧上社会神坛。“服役换服务”，军事服役也能确保黑人社群有尊严地通过政府的老兵补贴而受益。"
 USA_right_to_denial_desc:0 "融合并不是整个国家的万能药，个体社区需要的是精确且合适的调整。我们根本不需要在一个全是白人的州里推行种族融合制度，也不需要让那些黑人校区表现优异的学校合并校区。\n\n我们将会在我们的融合法律当中添加许多“例外”。私立学校已经被当成例外了，但只要公立学校努力争取，他们也能得到成为“例外”。我们不关系他们的理由有多么扯淡，只要他们愿意付出，就有资格按照肤色来进行录取。"
 USA_all_together_desc:0 "黑色，白色，绿色，红色，我们就不能把这种肤色问题放在一边吗？民权问题是我们国家的一道血淋淋的伤口，而李梅总统要做的，就是在华莱士被弹劾下台这一彻底崩溃中摆脱这种不幸的争论，将国家团结在一起。现在黑人与白人也许不愿群聚，但等到敌人来的那一天，我们会联手把他们赶出去！\n\n李梅总统将会对全国发表一次电视演说以缓解这种紧张氛围。他会告诉民众，目前的新民权立法将会是民权斗争的最终答案。他同样希望能够激起曾经美国民众携手对抗日本帝国主义的记忆与对战争中失去一切的复仇激情。希望这一切能遮掩住美国巨人身上的伤口，让他们继续前行。"
 USA_protect_our_troops_desc:0 "军队我们国家最受爱戴的组织。他们是为我们赢得一战又在二战中虽败犹荣的英雄。现在，他们中的一位坐进了椭圆形办公室，他们终将得到自己应得的尊重。\n\n李梅总统将会发表一次鼓吹军队并充满复仇主义言论的演讲，把军队称为“我们国家最宝贵的遗产”与“夺回割让领土的唯一希望”。但愿这能让我们部队在外界民权问题甚嚣尘上的当下保持士气。"
 USA_separate_but_equal_desc:0 "布朗诉教育委员会案什么用都没有。如果学校真有那么平等，那为什么社会各界还一直为它的隔离问题争论不休呢？的确，我们能很明显的看出隔离校区导致的教育质量问题。但如果非裔儿童能够得到良好的教育，那就没有必要去把它塞进白人班级，这样政府便不必插手录取问题了。\n\n李梅总统将会宣布增加黑人校区的投资并承诺将在未来合理的时候将校区合并。只要非裔儿童现在能得到良好的教育，融合事务便能放一放了。希望这能在不惹恼国民党团的情况下安抚好进步党团。"
 USA_air_power_above_all_desc:0 "如果美国空军敢称第二，那便没人敢称第一了。我们的飞机数量与制造技术都远远领先于同时代的任何国家。我们高高在上的飞行员将会彻底控制天空，并让脚下的日军四散而逃。如果要在找出一项整个NPP都坚定支持的东西，那就是那句“炸死日本佬”的口号！\n\n李梅将会增加对空军的投资预算，他的军事母校及其分校都会装配上最好的设备以确保未来战役中的胜利。希望这项军队投资能够在局势升级时使日本佬吃瘪。"
 USA_personal_problems_desc:0 "李梅总统在他的总统生涯中已经做出了太多牺牲。他以公约之名，牺牲了他的信念，他的目标，甚至是他的灵魂。他完成了自己的分内之事，他成为了一位公约所希望他成为的那种总统，他会让他的继承者感到自豪。他已经做下自己能力范围内的一切努力，搞定了所有大家指望他去做的事。\n\n但为什么那些进步党人还是不满足？为什么他们整天还嚷嚷着这一权利那一权利？他都已经把那操蛋的种族融合承诺给他们了。他们到底还想从李梅这里索取什么？他已经干完自己该干的事了，现在他要退休去了。如果那些温和派还是这样不满那样不满，那就是他们自己的问题。"
 USA_moderate_roots_desc:0 "在加入NPP而成为国民党团之前，我们曾经是由巴顿将军所领导的爱国党，我们曾矢志不渝地向日本人寻求复仇，而现在却在这里舔着南方政治精英们所提出的种族主义体系。是时候让我们将注意力重新放回我们的主线上了，让我们再次成为美国爱国者的共同联盟，无论肤色如何，他们都与我们一样渴望着复仇。\n\n李梅将会以超乎常人的强硬态度公开反对种族主义。他将会向玛格丽特·蔡斯·史密斯与斯皮罗·阿格纽这样的非种族主义爱国者抛出橄榄枝。李梅将会按照巴顿将军的意愿重建国民党团，即使则意味着他必须把整个愤怒嘶吼着的公约重塑成它最初的模样。\n\n§R华莱士与李梅是在种族主义的名号下走进白宫的，而那些投票者显然不会对公约的猝然转向感到开心……§!"

 USA_alienate_the_FR_NPP_desc:0 "李梅总统绝不是种族主义者的盟友，他已经通过谴责华莱士主义来将这一消息告知了整个美国。乔治·华莱士也许在数个月前确实是整个公约的领导者，但现在坐在领袖席位上的人已经换成了李梅。在这全新的国民党团内，隔离主义将在今天废止，明天废止，天天废止。你要是不爽，可以从这个党里滚出去，另寻高明。\n\n李梅将会将支持融合政策作为留在国民党团内的硬性要求。这将会提纯党团并推动其成为一个真正的爱国主义政党，而非隔离主义泥沼。这也许会惹恼我们的南方支持者，但如果他们不喜欢总统的所作所为，总统也不需要他们在他的党内吃白饭。\n\n§R“如果这些隔离主义者们被驱逐出§!£GFX_npp_fr_texticon §g国民党团§!，§R那他们也只有§j一个派系§!§R可去了……”§!"

 USA_southern_hospitality_desc:0 "李梅虽然支持种族融合，但这并不意味着他憎恶南方；是南方自己选择拥抱隔离主义。而南方也欢迎并有意加入国民党团，因此，我们可以抛出一个全新的精神旗帜，让他们再度痴狂。\n\n我们将会在深南部开展战略，提出一个好客温和的南方形象。我们引导南方人将自己认同为对一切的宽容，友善且文质彬彬的君子。希望这能在李梅提出他宏伟计划时，减少我们在南方的损失。"
 USA_perfectly_balanced_desc:0 "在华莱士时代，公约内的“进步党团”不值一提。那时，国民党团几乎操控着整个公约，并把进步党团挤到一边去。但在李梅的领导下，两派的话语权将会趋近相同。在从国民党团中把隔离主义者赶出去并与民主党自由派交好之后，NPP内国民党团与进步党团的权力已然平衡。故此，现在正是在其他方面也推动平等的好时机。\n\n随着公约秩序井然，李梅将不再掩盖他个人的政治愿景。这将会包括企业友好型税务改革，教育领域投资，加强军队建设，以及重新提出民权法案。在甩掉了隔离主义者的重担后，李梅总统已经做好了将理想付诸现实的准备。"
 USA_military_model_to_integration_desc:0 "一些想要成为政治家的资本家们会说“我会像经营我的生意那样经营我的国家”。而李梅，嗯，他也准备这么做，不过他是按照“经营军队的方式经营国家”。\n\n作为三军统帅，李梅将会下令在禁止军队中的种族隔离制度，这一目标将比信仰更加坚定。指令一经下发，武装军队的一切种族隔离制度都将灰飞烟灭，他们将会成为现代美国的榜样。"
 USA_tax_breaks_for_business_desc:0 "莱斯特·马多克斯也许对匹克威克餐厅服务黑人感到不爽，但如果你告诉他，这会让他欠山姆叔叔的债款减少一点，也许就能让他冷静下来。\n\n李梅总统将会在打压企业的同时也让他们尝点甜头。他将会在商业税上大砍一刀以促进经济的发展，不仅如此，这还有可能提升他在美国资产阶级眼中的形象，并让他们接下来关于民权立法的战斗中为他效力。"
 USA_expand_the_GI_bill_desc:0 "自从1944年通过了军人权利法案后，那些曾经服务于这个国家的人们终于可以放下心来，享受国家提供的服务了。但这还不够，现今美国萧条的一大原因就是因为那些退伍军人认为自己在二战战败后受到了忽视与不敬。我们是时候改变这一切了。\n\n李梅总统将会修订拓展G.I.法案，退伍军人们现在可以去其所在州中任何一所公立大学就读，学费全免，未来的失业补救和退休金也会更高。这将促使我们的退役军人仍然能为我们的经济做出奉献并感受到他们服役所带来的回报。"
 USA_university_tax_breaks_desc:0 "大学学生数量的激增无疑会急剧消耗大学内的资源。如果我们想让那些退伍者受到的教育是完完整整而非缺胳膊少腿，我们就得下场去帮助我们的大学。\n\n李梅总统将会减免大学税收。这应该能减缓他们对新宿舍楼建设与教学计划预算紧张的现状。希望这能让我们的教育水平再上一个台阶。"
 USA_pull_back_economic_intervention_desc:0 "除了落实种族融合外，政府没有任何理由干预私有经济。这是李梅从华莱士主义中唯一学到的一点。联邦政府不是每个小商铺主的保姆，是时候让我们的经济开始百花齐放了。\n\n李梅将会放松企业规章并终止那些意图干预经济的项目。这将会为政府省下一大笔钱，同时也能解放企业，让他们更好的为经济服务。"
 USA_militarized_schools_desc:0 "运行军队机器需要齿轮，而那些从高中毕业的学生自然是最好的选择。为了确保那些潜在的应征者不会去读大学或跑去工作，我们得把征兵人员直接送进学校为那些学生铺好路。\n\n李梅将会为全国高中的征兵活动提供资金。而那些征兵人员将会摆好桌子，对那些学生发表上一番鼓动人心的话语，告诉他们为什么服务国家是一条极佳的职业道路。这应该会增加我们的征兵数量。"

However, Goldwater is very staunchly right-wing economically, and may shoot down any idea of Social Security in its entirety.\n\nThe other half of the room suggests reaching out to RFK, the brother of the late President Kennedy. While RFK's progressives are a smaller caucus than Goldwater's, RFK will surely listen closely to our proposal, given his activist leanings, and is more likely to bring his caucus behind him.

Both of the Kennedy brothers led a small, but powerful wing of the Democratic Party which holds many similarities to our own NPP Progressives branch. Progressive but by-the-book and in line with RDC ideals, their influence is not to be underestimated.\n\nEspecially today.\n\nWallace knows that Kennedy is a pinko liberal in wolf's clothing; only a Democrat because his family was. Kennedy knows that Wallace is a spineless, racist populist to American progressives; a kingmaker, a scion, and perhaps one of the greatest political devils of the modern era. Despite this though, the two men sat down at a table to talk about Social Security.\n\n\"You know, I'd practically be crucified back in my caucus for agreeing with many points of an NPP bill. Yet, it has everything I'd want to pass if I was in your seat, Mr. President.\"\n\nWallace smiled. \"Perhaps if things went a bit differently, you'd be sitting exactly where I would be, boy. So this is your chance to make things right. Help me pass this, and you'll take part in the glory of saving the downtrodden in this county.\"\n\nBobby gritted his teeth. \"As long as there's none of that separate-but-equal nonsense, or any of your racial southern appeasement... I think I'm game.\""

 wallace.613.desc:0 "\"Are you serious, President Wallace? Do you really expect us to stand for this bill now with all of that disgusting racially charged acumen in it? We're supposed to be helping everyone in this country!\"\n\nBobby has had enough. After tense negotiation to latch Progressive Democrat support to Wallace's Social Security bill, avowed segregationist policy in the bill was the straw that broke their back. And with RFK at the helm, it was likely he would use his influence in the Democratic Party to spread negative feedback about the bill across the floor.\n\n\"Bobby, Bobby! Listen to me. Standing up for the poor doesn't mean standing up for colored people! Good white men and women are among the poor you claim to represent! Are you gonna abandon your principles for-?\"\n\nKennedy, clenching his fists and being held back by his aides, cut Wallace off and furiously lashed back. \"Fuck you, you racist bastard! I'd rather die on my brother's grave than appease your racist, whitewashed, disgusting attempt at aid for the poor. This bill has more holes in it than the swiss cheese on my sandwich this morning, and it's going to fail outside of your little cadre of backward, authoritarian warhawks. You hear me?\"\n\nWallace said nothing, simply walking away. It seems that any hopes of bipartisan support were swiftly dashed with the denouncement of the heir to America's civil rights legislation. Kennedy's words may even ring true with the NPP Progressives. And with that, Wallace felt his heart hang heavy as, for the first time since election night, he was scared for a future in which he may fail. A future where all of his work was for naught."

With President Wallace at the helm of the Southern wing, Margaret Chase Smith is the political scion of the Northerner Nationalists. Both are powerful figures in the pact, and both of them need to come together to pass Social Security.\n\n\"Miss Smith, a pleasure to have you in the Oval Office. I'm glad to finally be reaching out to the entire party. We are not just the branch of the South, you know.\"\n\n\"Naturally, George. We're here to get this Social Security bill passed, hmm? A shining piece of NPP legislation, able to help the man in the south or the man in the North.\"\n\nWallace and Smith got along very well, discussing and debating the intricacies of the bill together. What they settled on was a comprehensive compromise; something every supporter and legislator of the Nationalists could agree on. \"Well, Mr. President, we're set. I'll let my fellow Northern legislators know about these changes. And we will get it passed, I'm sure of it.\"\n\nWallace grinned, and shook Smith's hand. \"North and South working together for the good of the nation. That's what I like to hear.\""

While other legalistic and esoteric readings of the law and the Constitution were used by the lawyers in the Supreme Court to support their case, the media simplified it as a battle between the arch-segregationist George Wallace and the egalitarian instincts of mostly Northern and Western States opposed to federal programs explicitly segregating the workforce it hires, especially when reports of the appalling conditions provided for the nominally \"separate but equal\" camps for Black workers.\n\nWhile the White House hasn't said anything yet, the mood there must be downtrodden and angry that the Supreme Court has used its authority to render the Administration's most important make-work program to help the poor and unfortunate null and void.

After a few moments of silence, Wallace turned, nodded his head at Kennedy, saying \"Mr. Kennedy, please, sit down, you wanted to speak after all.\" As Robert Kennedy stepped forward with a smile, shook his hand, and sat down ahead from the President.\n\n\"Well, Mr. President, I wanted to start our little meeting off with congratulating you, sir, as these past few years have finally managed to bring our pact to victory. Actually, before we continue, would you like a drink to celebrate?\" He said, pulling out a small flask. The President, offering a small smile, pulled out some glasses to enjoy, as Kennedy poured the drinks and the men toasted. \"Well, President Wallace, I know that you are a man of business and work, so while I would love to continue the cheering, we ought to move on to the business.\" Wallace's smile faded slowly. \"President Wallace, you are a man of patriotism and party, you have fought and bled your way all the way to the top, and now, you have the opportunity to do great things for the country. In this,\" he stopped to drink, \"the children of America deserve just as great an opportunity as any of us. While the people of America deserve choice, the great freedom of choice, these are children we're talking about here, Mr. President. Segregation, although it's a choice, is not going to make these kids' lives any better, sir.\"\n\nWallace leaned back in his chair in contemplation of Kennedy's statement, twiddling his thumbs. After leaning forward, he looked at Robert in the eyes and said, \"Mr. Kennedy, do you realize that I have built my entire foundation on the freedom of the American people? On guaranteeing their rights. Children's education or not, this has gotten me into the Presidential office, what has gotten the NPP to finally succeed after all these years of Republican and Democratic bullshit. Now, tell me, Mr. Kennedy, how would I be able to continue from here?\" Kennedy felt the tension in the room skyrocket before saying, \"By putting heart and mind over the number of votes, Mr. President.\""

It just so happened that the same President Wallace swore off television, radio, telephones for the day, declaring that he had too much work to do and that they'd only distract him. He even said \"not to dare walk into the Oval Office unless the Japanese are storming San Diego.\" It wasn't until the Secretaries and Aides of the office got so pent up with fear that they shoved one man under the bus to do the work: that timid kid, Wilson. They shoved him forward to enter the office. Greeted with a fuming \"What?\" from the President before Wilson picked up. \"Um, sir, uh, the news, sir.\"\n\nThey were just lucky enough to catch a rerun of the official entire rant given to NBC that morning. \"This is Howard Reig with NBC Nightly News, and now, Mr. Kennedy, you seemed quite eager to join us on the news, and we couldn't turn you down! Tell us, what's got you so pent up this morning, Robert?\" the newscaster asked. \"We'll, Mr. Reig, I'd like to explain a grievous insult to the American spirit and the National Progressive Pact's goals as a whole. You see, I had a meeting with President Wallace yesterday about the status of segregation of the education system. Now, obviously, I represent the Progressive wing of the NPP, and thus I care to spread social justice towards Americans, especially the children of America. President Wallace, however, seems to spit in the image of that belief. He instructed me to, as the President himself said, 'get the hell out of his office, Bobby,' at my request that he laxes certain positions for the betterment of our next generation.\" \"You're saying that the President said that to you, Mr. Kennedy?\" Reig asked. \"Absolutely, sir. While I have met several lowly politicians in my lifetime, never in my life have I met an obstinate, ignorant, angry child in the form of a man that wishes to undo the education system for the color of people's skin.

Today, it was a pristine envelope with a higher quality than that of kings of foreign lands. On the front, the envelope was sealed with a large wax \"K.\" Wallace tore it apart, revealing a large note adorned with the words \"Call me.\" followed by the signature of Robert Kennedy.\n\nThe conversation seemed to last for hours. Wallace dialed the phone to hear an explosion of fury on the other end of the line, as a furious Bobby Kennedy awaited the President. \"Kennedy, calm the hell down, what are you trying to say?\" asked Wallace. \"What am I trying to say? You no good, double-crossing liar, you swore you would not dare touch the northern united states with your segregating hands, and look at what you did! You tried to upend the social order and plant your damned racist crap everywhere! What happened to promises, are those not official down in Alabama?\" Kennedy responded. \"Oh.\" Wallace said slowly, nearly chuckling as he did so. \"Well, you see, Bobby, promises mean all the world in Alabama. However, that's part of the game here in Washington. Maybe your big ole \"Da\" didn't tell you, but he lost his role in the party, became a loser, because he couldn't keep up with the game, unlike myself, who will not lose for this country as you will and your father did. Sorry for your inconvenience.\" \"You no good son of a-\" the line clicked as Wallace promptly hung up the phone. \"The NPP isn't going to survive on good gestures like he has planned.\"\n\nThat evening, American television captured one of the greatest political spectacles in modern history. Robert \"Bobby\" Kennedy joined NBC Nightly News host Howard Reig to express his \"dissatisfaction\" with the Wallace presidency. His dissatisfactions ranged from George C. Wallace being a \"racist\" to a \"liar\" to \"pig-headed\" to \"an angry child who seems to hate the children around him.\" LeMay, Burke, and Mills had joined him in the Oval Office during the live airing that night. Wallace turned off the television set, prompting the three men to turn towards the President to gauge his reaction. Wallace got up silently, walked to grab the chair that Kennedy sat on during their discussion, and slammed it repeatedly into the television set, destroying the glass and collapsing the framework."

Wallace was wading through these thoughts when he was suddenly interrupted by a phone call. \"Hello?\" Wallace asked. \"Good morning, sir, Robert Kennedy's on the line, would you like me to patch it through to you?\" his secretary asked. \"Sure, sure, put Bobby on the phone.\" The phone clicked and Wallace heard a new voice pour through, \"President Wallace, are you there, sir?\" \"Sure, Robert, what do you need?\" Wallace responded. \"Well, sir, I wanted to say that I genuinely appreciate the actions you've taken following our little discussion. It's nice to know that in the modern day, I have someone I can rely on, different or not. With that, be sure to tune into the NBC Nightly News tonight, I think you'll enjoy it.\" Wallace was appreciative in the end, saying that \"A promise is a promise.\" Before they ended the conversation.\n\nThat night, as work was wrapping up for the President, he turned on the television set within the Oval Office. Turning it to the news channel, Wallace was greeted with a flashy logo before zooming into the host and Robert Kennedy himself. \"Good evening folks, this is Howard Reig with NBC Nightly News, and I am joined by Robert F.

How are you doing this evening, Mr. Kennedy?\" Kennedy responded strongly, saying \"I'm doing quite well tonight, it's a beautiful evening with beautiful happenings in Washington.\" \"Really? And what may that be, Mr. Kennedy?\" Reig asked. \"Well, sir, the details are a rather private matter, but they do concern President Wallace, a firm member of the NPP, and as I've come to realize, a truthful and loyal man.\" \"Now, as far as I know, Wallace and you have come to blows in the past over issues, correct?\" Reig asked. \"You may be correct, Mr. Reig. However, agree or disagree with anyone, it isn't about that. To recognize the virtues laid within a man, even if you may happen to harbor completely different world views. That is where the term \"respect\" comes into play, especially in the circles of Washington D.C.\" For the rest of the evening, Reig and Kennedy continued to go back and forth about different ideas and respect. But no matter what, Wallace knew his concessions may cost him. But in the end, he knew he did the right thing."

Battles across the United States, not with rifles and bombs, but with words and bills. The North hadn't backed down faced with Wallace's desire to finally segregate the education system, and every day, more and more resources, time, and effort had to be dedicated to this process. It was exhausting to everyone, including the President. However, in the middle of a few advisors pinpointing possible speeches and campaigns to earn the President's approval, a phone call interrupted the action of the room. \"Hello?\" asked Wallace. \"Copy this down, Mr. President, every word of it. I can't be on the phone for too long, but you're going to want to hear this.\" A raspy voice called back. The men in the room aside from Wallace stood silent as the scratches of pen meeting paper and the occasional \"Uh huh.\" and \"Are you sure?\" came from the President.

Who was that?\" LeMay responded. \"Wouldn't say, but it's not who they are that matters, it's what they said.\" Wallace said, walking over to point at the map. \"There, Pennsylvania. Strong voiced Senator, direct opposer of segregation in the North, and absolute opponent of it for anywhere in the United States. However, that strong voice of his may die down a bit when he may hear we know about the kid he has outside of his marriage that he hangs around and makes payments for.\" Wallace said. \"A bastard? No offense, sir, but is that going to be enough to really push him to work with us?\" LeMay responded. \"Definitely, when we inform the public of the slant-eyed bastard.

Days since, with proceedings going on regarding possible groundbreaking developments of moving segregation northward. The President was anxious, fearful even, pacing around the Oval Office with the passing hours in every day. What if he wouldn't back down? What if this backfires? Not a damned word had come forth from that powerful anti-segregationist, not a protest, not a speech, not even so much as a whisper. That is, until the Senate proceedings from the day had concluded.\n\nNews anchors across the country had all begun reporting the same story, the same flip on the entire case of segregation: now, it had seemed a small coalition of Senators seemed to be organizing in support of the legislation put forward by the Wallace administration. Legislation permitting the possible expansion of segregation of the education system in Northern States. A coalition headed by a formerly iron-willed Senator from Pennsylvania who had argued each and every piece of work supported by President Wallace. Senate leaders were baffled, the RDC members in Congress collapsed into infighting, as reported by some newscasters. The nation seemed to wonder what could have possibly gotten Wallace the lucky break he needed after the fights he experienced in the legislation process. LeMay came into the office, noticing a wicked grin strewn across the President's face, prompting him to ask, \"Any reports from the Senator?\"\n\nWallace responded that \"We didn't get a report; however, we got a whole goddamn bloc of Democrats voting for us in the Senate.\" The President and the Vice President shook hands at their newfound success, laughing at the blurry image of the Senator's face on the screen."

On one hand, this is one of the most lowly, deplorable actions to be committed by a man in as high a position as Wallace found himself in. On the other, Wallace found the prospect of nationwide segregation to be there, laid within his palms, waiting to be clutched, for his name to go down in history as the man who overturned political ties to embrace the good traditions of the Southern United States. And that damned phone ringing was the one thing he needed for all of this to happen.\n\nFinally, the phone upon his desk began ringing its usually annoying, but now exciting for the President. \"Who's there?\" He asked, frantically. The raspy voice answered, \"He's not buying into it.\" Silence persisted for a few, critical moments, moments of building fear, tension, and fury. \"Why in the hell not? Didn't you push hard enough, and say something about guaranteeing this fucking guy? What happened?\" Wallace said. \"It's not that easy, if we keep going, we'll risk being found out. At the very least, we know one thing at the moment: he's not backing down, no matter what I threw against him. He doesn't believe in the slightest that we'd dare leak the information, that we're just 'disgusting,' and that all this would be a bluff that would blow over. And that's the censored version of what he had to say.\" the raspy voice responded. \"Fuck, fuck, fuck. So, with all of this built up, what are our options then?\" The President said, rubbing the stress out of his forehead. \"In tough spots like this, this operation of ours could take two different routes: either we comply, do as he says, back down and not return until we have more dirt on him. The other direction would be to fire the loaded gun: leak the info, fucking destroy him where he stands and hope to God that he doesn't crawl back in to fight back.\"\n\nThe President was left in a frustrated state of stress and worry, with hopes that his heart wouldn't give out after all this. Either we swing with what we have or we back off, either way we could be absolutely fucked. The clock was ticking before the man had to hang up to avoid connection."

After so long, President Wallace shall break down the obstacles and pave his way forward after all of the infighting. Or so he had thought.\n\nPresident Wallace and Vice President LeMay sat in the Oval Office, watching the black and white screens within the television sets of the office. There, they saw speeches turned into protests turned into riots, all in the span of a day, as more people fought and bled and died within the span of a few hours. Banners waved and burned, displaying the President's face adorned with the words \"Slanderer!\" and \"Corrupt!\" As far as they were concerned, the people of America had finally been brought out in full outrage; however, not by the possibility of segregation, but rather, the rules of a game which had been played in Washington for decades. One newscaster over another described \"the situation in Pennsylvania\" as being pure chaos, as fights between Pennsylvanians erupt defending their Senator and his child, defending the President's actions, and the police trying to maintain law and order in the broken social situation they find themselves in. Even on the Congressional floor, Representatives postur the prospect of illegality within the actions of President Wallace, while Senators rush to defend their honor by standing behind the disgraced Republican from Pennsylvania.\n\nPresident Wallace waltzed behind his desk and nearly fell into his chair. He nearly broke open one of the drawers, taking out a flask and two shot glasses. \"Well, if we're against the world, right?\" He asked LeMay, raising a glass of whiskey to his Vice President.

Joining him, Arleigh Burke and Wilbur Mills sat nervously, doing their best to prepare for anything that may happen there.

Whether it be by your beliefs or mine, we have grown strong; however, I need you to use that strength.\" Wallace said, as the men and women at the table brace themselves, some distracted from their orders. Wallace continued, \"Many of you will protest, maybe already are protesting, but segregation of the Northern States is necessary as the National Progressive Pact's next step forward. Why? Well, to be completely damn honest, I believe in segregation. And with my belief in segregation, comes the Nationalists's belief in segregation. And with more members, our whole entire party grows stronger. So, I ask: how in the hell could we not survive for another Presidential term without this victory? Goddamnit, the people are rioting out there! Cities are fucking burning, your goddamn cities! We're better than this, so I invoke into you all the courage to rise above the principles and realize that this is about survival. I'm fighting my hardest in my time in the sun, and the sun shall rise to you all one day if you stand behind me!\"\n\nThe room was silent, choked even, from the furious spiel they had just been subject to.

After months of preparation, demographic analyses, and cross-party discussions and negotiations, the Executive Federal Aid Spending Act was forged, allowing for extended power in federal intervention in areas of state budgets, a baffling resolution on the side of President George C. Wallace, who has previously expressed his disgruntlement with federal intervention before.\n\nHowever, the confusion of the United States has not served to bring down the excitement present in the administration. President George C. Wallace strongly advocated for the success of the bill, saying, as it entered into the Senate, that \"Tyranny is the death of all nations. However, we'll be damned sure to use the strength of our economy for the betterment of Americans, not the other way around.\" Furthermore, the National Progressive Pact as a whole has remarked that the Wallace administration's success has been \"a great success in the step for bipartisanship in an era of division and separation, with betterment for everyone in the country ensured.\" as one spokesperson for the Progressive wing of the NPP stated.\n\nNevertheless, groups of Americans have rallied in protest of the signing of the bill into law, with some of the more moderate factions of the country finding the situation abhorrent. \"The National Progressive Pact has cultivated, fed, and nurtured an abomination to enter into the Congress, and they happily allowed such a mischievous, gross violation of constitutional American justice to allow for a huge step in party strength.\" one Democrat said, waving around a banner depicting a crown atop President Wallace's head as they marched in protest.

One member of the House of Representatives, who wished to remain anonymous, stated that \"The Republican-Democratic Coalition finds the President's lack of success in the amalgamation of the worse sides of traditionalism and progressivism to be a great victory in terms of American stability and progress.\" Though the country remains divided, everyone is alert for the potential future after the administration's failure in Congress."

And, well, Mr. President, given that you're you, and that I'm me, we both know what this comes down to, in regards to the segregative material of the bill. Take that out, and you have yourself a deal, Mr. President.\"\n\nIt took all of the President's willpower to not slap the man in that very instant. However, Claude Denson Pepper escaped the Oval Office, having made a handshake and having heard a very soft 'Goodbye' on his way out."

This freedom obviously comes in the form of our representative democracy here in the United States; however, President Wallace and his administration have taken to a more economic interpretation of the nickname, as constant work has been put forward to free the American market from federal intervention as much as possible. However, today stands as a landmark for the President's successes, as the State Financial Independence Act, also called SFIA, which intends to cut incredible amounts of federal infrastructural intervention, has come to pass in Congress.\n\nOn one side, the administration has collectively cried to joy, as constant fighting back and forth between the legislative and executive branches have finally made some leeway in the success of the Act. President Wallace himself commented, stating that \"Americans across the country will enjoy unprecedented economic freedom, without the worry of regulations, rules, and governance from Washington D.C. any longer.\" Meanwhile, several Southern Democrat and Nationalist Governors have offered their conjoined support for the President and the State Financial Independence Act, with many claiming that the capital held a stranglehold on their potential workings towards the American infrastructure for years.\n\nNevertheless, large swathes of the population find outrage with the passing of the bill, and many have protested the legislative branch itself, claiming that it's become bullied by President George C. Wallace. Ardent Progressives of both parties and blue-collar workers came together to oppose the passing of the bill, with one Republican representative offering a statement, saying that \"President Wallace and his entire administration seek for nothing more but the abandonment of the American people, because he intimidates, he's a bully!\" Besides party divides, many economic analysts have stated that the drastic turn for the American economy will take time to tell its benefits and misgivings."

Meanwhile, several company heads have expressed outright enragement over the failure of the bill, with one company representative stating, \"The United States House of Representatives and Senate has had it out for the President ever since he stepped foot in office. Now, they'll even keep us in this chokehold of regulations and bureaucracy, and I, along with my shareholders, can hardly take any of it anymore! What's there for us?!\"\n\nHowever, not all are as disgusted with the failings of the President to pass the State Financial Independence Act. Many supporters of federal intervention, as well as many coalitions of blue-collar workers have voiced their thanks for the President's failures, with one representative of a Construction Workers organization in Pennsylvania saying, \"President George C. Wallace thinking he's going to magically save the economy by clearing his work schedule is not going to help anyone in the United States of America. Now, we all have the ability to receive all of the funding we need to help our states prosper without the abandonment of the United States government.\" Several political analysts have recorded that the failure of the State Financial Independence Act will cost a significant blow towards the President and his administration, but only time will tell if these failures will persist in the future."

The Education Financial Reorganization Act will help all those schools tied up in the bureaucratic mess of Washington to find a new and prosperous future in connection with their states.\"\n\nHowever, while strong proponents for state freedoms celebrate, others, including some within the education system itself, have produced sharp criticism of the President. One prominent member of a Wisconsan School Board, who asked to remain anonymous, declared that \"President Wallace's despicable new act is going to choke the life out of hundreds, maybe thousands of schools across the United States! These children need help for God's sakes, not just to have their government drop all responsibilities for them, especially when some are already having to live in a state of financial crisis thanks to the Wallace administration's effects on the economy!\" Newest reports indicate state governments are rushing to introduce new legislation regarding school systems thanks to the new act."

One hardline leader of the Democrats, Representative James O'Hara spoke at a press conference just a few hours ago, saying that, \"The Southern Education Promise Act is a clear indication of President George Wallace's intention on supporting segregationist policies, whether it's written in the law or not.

Due to the direct focus of funds towards school's practicing unlawful segregationist policies through SEPA, many groups have figured that the bill was far more concerned with legislating support for segregationists in the United States. \"Yes, President Wallace and his administration sit behind the veils of 'states rights' and 'Southern support,' but we all know what's truly evolving in his mind,\" said one Civil Rights activist. \"The man's a virulent racist, trying to starve as many African-American children of knowledge as he can!\""

However, the Wallace administration has made a small breakthrough for the states today, as the National Education Budgetary Act, also known as NEBA, was signed into approval through the Senate, being signed into law by the President himself and severely cutting education spending whilst maintaining it as a federal decision, rather than delivering it to the states.\n\nThe Wallace administration recognizes NEBA as the small push needed to bring about a recognition of the rights of states whilst maintaining a degree of power towards the federal forces of the country. Treasury Secretary Wilbur Mills spoke today regarding the passage of NEBA, saying, \"While NEBA retains federal control over a degree of the education system, know that it is still the administration's top priority to ensure that each and every American feel empowered by the federal government, while earning the money they deserve by cutting the fat on this bloated economy!\"\n\nHowever, while the men and women of the Nationalists cheer for dreams of a brighter economy, others, many of whom working or have worked within the education system, moan in disturbance regarding President Wallace and the executive cut on education spending, leading many to fear that a complete chokehold and blackout in monetary terms for schools across the country. \"What can I do, I teach history to sophomore's for God's sakes, how can I do that if we're not even going to be able to scrape together money for the janitors?\" cried one Nevadan protestor."

And, with the Presidential administration's failure in the Senate to pass the National Education Budgetary Act, which would render funding for education as a federal matter but cut costs drastically, the fight shall continue onwards to decide the fate of American education.\n\nPresident George Wallace's administration has convened several times regarding the issue, having forwarded several official press documents stating \"a recognition of the swollen nature of education's budget and its drastic effect on the American economy.\" However, whether incoming reports indicate a sense of failure or reinvigoration following the defeat of NEBA, the true issue lies within the countless Americans taking to the streets protesting Congress' actions, whilst the President has reportedly taken the time to privately discuss the matter with several Nationalists Congressional leaders.\n\nWhere the President and all of the West Wing finds loss, however, others find reward. Schools across the country signify a sense of relief following the NEBA's destruction in Congress, having recognized that a cut on the education system could prove drastically detrimental to their efforts. \"We don't mean to always rally to politics every time there's an issue.

Through time immemorial, people referred to the United States as being the land of plenty, where anyone can do anything they wanted, all while making the success for themselves and their families that they desired. President George C. Wallace has shown his desire to uphold this notion, and has taken a step towards promoting the land of plenty ideal through the Local Business Relief Act, or LBRA, which offers an immediate flat tax relief towards local businesses and their owners, cutting control of the United States federal government from its own economy further. Whilst some praise President Wallace for his intentions to create an independent economy, others find it just another hole to fix in a leaky economic crisis.\n\nThe Nationalists have joined the Republicans today in celebrating a potential victory in the name of a free market, as small businesses have already rushed to work harder and produce more than before the tax relief. Just down the street from our news station, a local grocery market store owner was seen rushing to their business with a truckful of appliances and registers to upgrade the efficiency of his business. \"LBRA is a culmination of the logical reasoning backing President Wallace,\" says Treasury Secretary Wilbur Mills in a press conference today, \"and we will continue to take these sound steps for the sake of the American people!\"\n\nHowever, the state of the American economy following the Local Business Relief Act hasn't caused happy cheers for all. Stock owners have begun to notably scramble their investments following the Act, as local investor's offices have continued to receive phone calls regarding shifts and changes in future American finances. Meanwhile, public welfare advocates have assembled en masse to combat support for the Act, with one Democratic leader saying, \"America doesn't need to open more pitfalls regarding the help of its people and government.

After much debate over such a controversial bill, however, proponents of a more conservative nation have won out once more, putting an end to a variety of unemployment programs.\n\nThe recent changes at the hand of the executive office have delighted the President and the entirety of the Wallace cabinet, whose great desire for more independent local governments have produced this strong cut to the welfare programs of the United States. \"In earnest, President George Wallace, myself, and many other of our associates within the administration simply can't find where AWCA produces such a hard loss for America, if any loss at all,\" stated Treasury Secretary Wilbur Mills in a press conference today. \"Getting leeches off of the back of hardworking Americans who have toiled for years to benefit themselves and this country?

In particular, fringe members of the Nationalists have organized several rallies protesting the Wallace administration's actions. In several major cities across the Deep South, several burning banners and rallying cries adorn a speech against the President, with one southern leader saying, \"President Wallace may be a man of his country, he may be a man of his people, and of his good, righteous, Christian God. However, we cannot stand by in allowing the power of this country to be toppled by socialists and fearmongers!\""

Reuther declares a need for an Industrial Democracy and direct ties to the government, whilst Herbert Hoover proposed for \"rugged Americanism\" and the need for governmental step backs. In the middle, however, the fight for Workers Unions has faltered through the failure of the American Worker Union Consolidation Act, or AWUCA, which would have introduced harsh fines for construction companies who have been unwilling to bend to the rules and regulations set forth by workers' unions in the past, as well as offering a solution to party unity within the National Progressive Pact.\n\nThe entirety of the National Progressive Pact find themselves taken aback by the abrupt failure at the hands of the Senate today, as leadership within the pact has set out several dates of meeting by which to discuss the next step for bolstering Unions in the future, including President Wallace. Some have declared that the bill was just to progressive for the time; others, however, swear that it simply has to be \"RDC meddling in the legislature\" causing the failure. \"I really don't know how folks could be so entrenched as to allow genuine bi-partisan good to fail because it was introduced by the other guy.\" said one Chicago Progressive NPP leader, smoking a cigarette as the rest of office flys into chaos at the hands of congressional failure.\n\nNot all within the country find AWUCA so appealing, however, as an odd coalition of Republicans and fringe members of the Nationalists have found solidarity in the desire to tear apart AWUCA. The RDC, of course, seeks to make sure the NPP don't find another step in the political game, and has issued several statements from party leaders referencing the \"instability\" and the \"radicality\" of the act in question. Meanwhile, however, protests of the Nationalists declare AWUCA to be \"sickly,\" and that President Wallace has \"mistakenly chosen party unity over doing what is truly right for all pure-blooded countrymen in the United States of America.\" as one rally leader shouted."

Ahead of him, a bill laid on his desk, written out and ready for proposal: the American Worker Union Consolidation Act. Should be fine, worker help with party unity, but a nagging feeling ate at President Wallace's mind, the worry that the RDC were just such stubborn bastards that they'll refuse to stand by AWUCA. \"Sonovabitch.\" Wallace muttered, as he reached out towards the Oval Office's phone, twirling the dial a few times. \"Hello? Yes, this is Wallace. O'Hara, we need to talk...\"\n\nJust two days later, and President Wallace found himself across the desk from the famed Michigander representative, praised for his service, his dreams of the stars and stripes, and his never-ending charm. \"So, Mr. President, what is it that I can do to serve you today, sir?\" O'Hara asked. \"I'm glad you asked, O'Hara, cause we have a lot to discuss up here. Tell me, O'Hara, how cold does it get in Michigan?\" Wallace said, rising out of his chair and wandering towards the window. O'Hara had to sit back and think about the odd question the President asked. \"Well, sir, it can get quite chilly up there in the winter, why do you ask, sir?\"\n\nWallace shot his eyes back towards O'Hara. \"Cause that's just how fucking cold I feel proposing this Union act to the Senate, and if I don't get some more support from Democrats like you, then I think I'll just be freezing to death, now won't I?\" Wallace said, pouring a glass of whiskey for himself and the Senator. \"Ah, so hospitality for votes. I understand your bargain, Wallace, but we're gonna have to get something in return for all of this, sir. Throw in a few lines regarding Social Security and we have ourselves a deal here, sir.\"\n\nWallace could hardly contain his frustration regarding O'Hara's demands. If he gave in, that would mean he could jeopardize his status as the strongman of the pact, able to get the NPP to the Presidency like it never had before. If he refused, AWUCA could be left alone, and end up dead in the water. The silent room only rang out with the noise of a glass, as Wallace edged it towards O'Hara, asking for him to drink once more.\n\n\"Sorry, but I'm not the drinking type, Mr. President.\""

The storm over the United States, however, shows mixed feelings in this regard.\n\nPresident Wallace and the entirety of the White House administration have come out of the executive order feeling a sense of pride in their actions. The President himself gathered to the podium regarding his actions in signing the executive order, saying, \"While everyone in my administration and I cherish the ideals of states rights and hold them dear to our heart, it is with all good will that we seek to make the large financial cut across the board, in order to give each and every American more room to grow themselves out and make their own great supporting factors to our economy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, however, another sentiment has strewn across the opposition towards President Wallace's executive order: the enemy of my enemy is my friend. In that, several sects of fringe Nationalistsists, some would even say Fascist-influenced groups, and leaders of education have cried fury in regards to the President's great overreach, each taking to the streets with banners and poster-boards to signify their thoughts. \"President Wallace is thinking about that fat checkbook that got him to the Presidency, not for the kids which I stand by every day to teach and instruct on how to become great American citizens, the idea of which has surely escaped the President himself!\""

This is why the Department of State has decided to approach the both of you in proposing an alliance of trade security between the two of our nations. While the Germans have continuously impacted the state of the Union's economy, the Japanese regularly tear down our economic securities, thus prompting the following plan drafted by the most brilliant trade analysts the United States have to offer: in addition for the growth and spread of American-based businesses into the Iberian Union to stimulate economic sources from metropolitan and suburban areas, the United States will officially work to scale the importation of raw steel materials from the Iberian Union by one hundred and fifty percent. This will allow a raw financial boost towards the Iberian economy, and in exchange, the United States hopes for the Caudillos to downscale the ongoing trade relations with the Empire of Japan, to secure a more positive, economic outlook for Iberians and Americans alike.\n\nWith complete respect and honor towards your rule,\n\nGeorge C. Wallace, President of the United States\"\n\nIn the days following the securing of the trade alliance with Salazar and Franco, the RDC, especially that Barry Goldwater, tore into President Wallace for daring to associate Americans with the likes of Fascist dictatorships. \"However,\" President Wallace thought, \"they didn't get the first Holiday Inn built on the coast of Barcelona, did they?\""

From fighting in the trenches against the Germans in France during the First World War to the Defense of the British Isles led by American and Canadian men, the braveness and gallantry of our peoples have shaped the modern understanding of North America. However, once more, as the collapse of alliances failed the world against the Germans and Japanese, once more does a lack of unity threaten us all against the coercions of the Japanese in the Pacific, and the Organization of Free Nations will not fall in the face of evil. Thus, we shall organize an immediate increase in the importation of Canadian oil by one hundred and seventy-five percent, in order to benefit the American civilian and military economies while helping to shape the petroleum industry within the Canadian economy. While the drastic nature of the upscale in importation may seem rushed and immediate, it is within the best interests of both of our countries and our liberties to do so, under the threat of the Japanese Army and Naval forces as they grow throughout the Pacific.

Recently, the Wallace Administration forwarded a piece of legislation called the Education Rebudgeting Act towards the Senate in an attempt to rebalance funding towards schools across the United States. However, the Supreme Court has declared the bill to be unconstitutional, and cited that the bill is filled with obvious setbacks against African-American schools throughout the country, and has been said to be a \"deliberate attack on the African-American population's rights and freedoms in the United States.\" as said by one Supreme Court Justices.\n\nHowever, despite the protest from the Supreme Court, Wallace's base of support has found no wrong within the administration's piece of legislation. President Wallace himself responded by accusing the Supreme Court of \"attacking his rights as leader of the United States in repairing the broken education system of the United States by directing funds towards provenly efficient centers of education, rather than the unneeded schools that leech from the budget.\" Supporters of the Nationalists have stood behind President Wallace, as many have come to the steps of the Supreme Court with a variety of chants and banners, some demanding that the Supreme Court to stop acting so politically and to realize that the President is working for \"the more patriotic American people.\"\n\nHowever, the black community has stood in defiance of Wallace's supporters and stood with the Supreme Court. Many have found anger with Wallace in his actions, actively protesting the President and various NPP associations due to their distrust of the pact with the President's proposal. As said by one African-American man, \"This is the United States of America. Not Germany and not Japan, we are here to find justice for all, how do we dare accept the actions of such a vile attack against the already small education provided for African-American children?\" Some larger cities have even reported work protests and strikes supporting the Supreme Court against the Education Rebudgeting Act."

The African-American community have expressed their absolute resolution in ensuring the President does not interfere with their lives longer, and have begun a wide range of protests to the clauses of the Education Rebudgeting Act.

In this case, it's for those in education: teachers.

President Wallace had received call after call that he \"turned his back on large businesses\" and that \"the NPP was going broke with these welfare programs.\" However, as much as the complaints annoyed the President, they generated an idea. He called his secretary, asking her to \"get the numbers of the last three calls that came in.\"\n\nFinally, the day had arrived, and the city of Dallas, Texas was thriving just as much as it was scolding. Texans across the state saw their calendars display the day when President Wallace would appear to debate the growing farming companies overtaken small Texan farmers. And now, with the ending of the Governor of Texas' speech, the President was free to begin the debate. \"Firstly, I'd like to begin by thanking all of you patriotic Texans for coming out today to support me. As seen before me, there are those in the United States who believe the success of larger businesses reach over your economic freedoms.\" The three other men, led by a certain Mr. Lyle, adjusted their colors and scoughed, one saying at his podium that \"such a remark is rather far-fetched, Mr. President. You see, the three of us represent well-to-do companies seeking to employ such talented farmers into an umbrella communal business.\" Lyle stated. \"Yeah, and suck the blood, sweat, and tears of every farmer here. You don't give a damn about them, you just care about their paychecks!\" The crowd fired up hearing the President. \"Now, Mr. President, I believe you and I know that statement to be a bit far-fetched. After all, you championed the notions of a free and competitive American market, did you not?\" Lyle asked, with some farmers intrigued. \"I championed the notion of a market open and free to Americans themselves, not the overgrown cesspools of greed that large companies have become.\" The Texans clapped for Wallace's response. Finally, one of the representatives, looking red in the face, took the stand, yelling out, \"Well, Mr. President, if you're so keen on sticking out for them, why don't you tell them how you plan on affording all these handouts?\" The citizens of Texas looked towards the President, who appeared flustered. The moments of silence went by before Wallace answered out, \"The People of the United States are going to power the economy enough to afford it.\" The simple response set an even match for the debate."

And why would Wilson let him in? \"Anyways, he's here for that business meeting, I'll leave you two to it!\" Wilson said. \"Yeah, thanks, Wilson.\" Wallace responded.\n\n\"Well, good afternoon, Mr. President, it is an honor to be welcomed here to meet with you! May I sit here?\" Lyle asked, pointing to the chair in front of his desk. \"Yeah, sure,\" the President responded, \"now, what are you here for exactly?\" \"Well, I'm glad you asked, Mr. President, as Wilson didn't explain the situation as accurately as I'd hoped.\" Now the guy's making fun of my staff? Oh, what the hell? \"So, my company was one of the top contributors towards your campaign for Presidency, and in doing so, you promised a wide variety of economic freedoms for the people of the United States. We greatly appreciated the work of such a candidate willing to fight for the freedom of the market, as so many Presidents of the past led to restriction after restriction.\" Lyle continued. \"Okay, so what are you getting at?\" asked the President. \"Well, President Wallace, we've grown quite nervous. We've seen a continuously growing trend of freedoms of large companies, such as my own, to give towards the individuals of the United States.\" Wallace saw what was going on here, this Lyle, thinking he can walk in here like this. \"Listen here, Lyle. I've done what it takes to unite a broken party and broken nation, just cause your stocks aren't going through the roof doesn't mean the economy isn't booming more than it ever has before.\" Wallace boomed.\n\nTense silence flowed through the room after Wallace's intimidation. \"Well, in that case, Mr. President, I believe our meeting has concluded. Thank you for taking special consideration in the matter of my associates and myself, and just remember,\" Lyle continued, nearly out the door at that point, \"you're going to have to make a choice.\" he said, closing the door."

They'd touted their proximity to the President, and the expectation that in exchange for the privilege of access, business would need to support the Administration's more controversial policies. But taking sides so openly had been a nonstarter from the beginning, especially as opposition to Wallace's civil rights views had hardened. There were minimal expectations that the new guy would prove to be any better than the old.\n\nThe new business czar took his seat at the head of the table. \"I'm not here to lecture anyone. I'm not here to ask for favors or contributions. Politics is a turbulent business, and I know that turbulence is bad for business.

The minutes and bland platitudes wore onwards, until finally Wallace and his counterparty shook hands again and stood, walking towards the door.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce president leaned over and whispered into Wallace's ear. \"We appreciate the new direction of your business policies, Mr. President, despite our differences elsewhere.

With every regulation placed under executive review, or labor law taken up for watering down in Congress, the wallets of corporate America opened wider.\n\nWallace's own campaign coffers weren't benefiting quite as much, but that suited Wallace just fine. It'd all been a quid pro quo with the CEO's - he'd get out of their way on the economy, and they'd look the other way on civil rights. It was, after all, good business.\n\nAnd if one measured the value of one's policies by the opposition they generated, the condemnation of the NPP by organized labor, and the vigorous courting of the unions by the RDC, was evidence enough that the tables had indeed turned. Of course, there was the matter of the Progressive Caucus being put in a bind, caught between their union supporters and the Wallace administration, but Wallace found it hard to care too much when the money spoke for itself."

Ripping open the letter, it appeared to be another official message straight from some Senator from Ohio.\n\n\"To the President of the United States:\n\nIt is with fervent approval that we congratulate your efforts, President Wallace.

You would be correct, Mr. President, as it has grown more evident with the passing day that the President is wandering dangerously farther from his party's goals with every passing day.\" Goldwater said. \"Oh, and how is that, Senator Goldwater?\" Reig responded. \"Well, you see, Howard, President Wallace came into the Presidency promising to 'champion the ideals of the conservative American mind,' as he stated within a speech in Ohio. However, President Wallace has turned this idea on its head, and is expanding on the federal government further than it already was. New policies and regulations slither from the federal government in an effort to further the Wallace administration, and while it is not as bad as what could be possible from the National Progressive Pact, it's still a considerable threat to the people of the United States' freedoms and liberties, economically, socially, and politically. Mark my words, Howard, the proclamations of Wallace ought to serve as a warning to conservative Americans.\"\n\nPresident Wallace shut off the television set.

This was depicted a more political landscape; here, the state legislature was preparing to pass a variety of education reforms for an economically industrious, predominantly Christian school zone; however, the entire reform was blocked by a single vote, a Democratic state senator named Barrett, quoted as saying that \"I don't believe those kids need all that money, after all, my business is suffering, why not help me?\" Wallace knew that his entire party and beyond were counting on him to bring freedoms to the people of the United States.

He gathered Lurleen, and got his driver to bring them around the local D.C. area to \"check out the sights on this beautiful day.\" And a beautiful day it was, in Wallace's mind, as the more he looked around, the more he saw the signs. \"No Blacks Allowed!,\" \"Whites Only!,\" and, his personal favorite one he saw, \"Afroes go down the street!\" Even as he watched the streets, he knew that the United States was made White, in his image, as he had wanted it to be. All the while, Lurleen happily sat in the car beside her husband, lovingly.\n\nOn their way back to the White House, the President's vehicle had stopped at a red light.

Only time could tell for the two men as if they were about to bear witness to a bloodbath or a victory.\n\nThat morning, a group of forty-five black students departed from Druid High School, the black high school for the Tuscaloosa school zone, to march to the gates of Tuscaloosa High School, demanding to leave Druid as it emphasized the teaching of manual skills rather than promising a path to university-based education like Tuscaloosa High did, a segregated school of only Whites. Now, President Wallace stroked his chin as he watched the standoff between federal soldiers guarding the gates of the segregated school and the protesters. The gates were shut, the rifles were loaded, and each second ticked by while the possibility of a slaughter grew. While they occasionally gave off a single chant, the group of students were silent for the most part, acting as if entering Tuscaloosa High was their right, contrasting from the law. \"Stupid fucking kids, they need to get back home, we don't need this right now!\" Wallace said, slamming the Oval Office desk with his fist. \"The protesters aren't trying to fight anyone, they've calmly approached the guard asking to finally be let in.\" Byrd said. \"I don't give a flying fuck what those kids want. The law is the law, segregation is segregation, and they are not allowed to step a foot into that school's courtyard, Byrd!\" the President shouted at his National Security Advisor. The soldiers stood resolute in the face of the wall of protesters which had formed; meanwhile, a large crowd of white adults had begun flanking the forty-five students, shouting at them, demanding they move on.\n\nFinally, after a blood-curdling hour of anxiety, Wallace felt relief as the leader of the protesters backed down, and walked the group back down to Druid High School. Local and federal authorities were investigating the matter and the students involved.

Not only that, but the economy's bound to tank with the cities under fire like they are now.\" Wallace rubbed his forehead after his venting. \"Well, sir, we already have law enforcement units in route to contain the protests, and ordered them to maintain a level of containment over the surrounding areas which had been affected by the protests. Furthermore, while police units have been issued to the larger cities in order to suppress the riots and clean up any of the damage, the perpetrating groups appear to be far from finished in regards to their actions. Having said that, federal authorities are asking for permission to go on the offensive, to safeguard the streets.

It was a question that ate away at the President, but no matter what, he knew that with the growing troubles of the age, he was going to have to move in some direction, and do it soon.\n\nPresident Wallace wanted to guarantee the traditions of the patriotic citizens of the United States; however, the question of if this meant the separation of school-children had to be done to achieve this repeatedly flared up in the Alabaman's mind."

The fiery, hateful rage of George C. Wallace had seemingly faded as he faced a new enemy within the South.\n\nRobert Byrd had joined the President in watching and handling the growing situation in an effort to smother the flames engulfing the suburban South. \"Byrd, what in God's name has gotten into them down there, what's sparking all this? I swear, I've given the blacks more of what they wanted, isn't it all enough!\" Wallace asked in a rage. Byrd looked perturbed as he got off the phone to answer the President's question. \"Well, sir, that's exactly it. It's the hardline segregationists that are protesting and rioting, sir. One of NBC's reporters managed to capture a few lines from one of them, they said that 'Wallace isn't paying attention to his White voters, we don't want concessions, we want segregation!\" Wallace had to take a minute to take in the unfolding situation. \"Fuck.\" the President muttered, while wiping off his face, trying to regain control over his racing mind. \"No matter what anyone says, if it's the Blacks or the Whites, we aren't going to allow some hardliners to push us around, Byrd. What's the status of law enforcement in the affected areas?\" The President asked Byrd. \"As far as we can tell, dozens of units of local and state police forces have been deployed in the suburban areas where the riots are taking place, and others are swerving around to deal with some of the smaller protests. Reports of arson, vandalism, battery, theft, and more have exploded in Louisiana, Tennessee, and Virginia suburbs where the states have tried to handle the riots, while federal forces are on their way to further suppress the outbreaks of violence.\"\n\nThe suburbs, places of industriousness and the growth of the family, now engulfed in the fire of hardliners. Wallace could only hope that the situation was handled quickly for the sake of America."

 wallace.236.desc:0 "Once again, in a Presidency seemingly full of televised conflict, President Wallace's eyes were glued to the television as a standoff grew more tense by the moment. Beside him, Byrd was on the phone coordinating responses with the Army National Guard as well as piecing together coordinated movements by local and state law enforcement. Plastered all over television stations, the country watched as rifles were loaded and American stood against American.\n\nNear the border of Texas and Arkansas, a Texan Army National Guard base stood strong. However, arriving from nearby suburbs, a group of hardline segregationists and racial groups calling themselves the Vandals, rallied near the gates of the armory, challenging the federal government due to their softening of policy regarding segregation and the softer approach to Black America as a whole. In response, the Brigadier General commanding over the base deployed a Military Police Platoon to meet the Vandals at the gates. Now, the two groups stand in the middle of one of the tensest showdowns of American history, as the Vandals' creep forward could transform the area into a bloodbath. Meanwhile, in Washington, the White House, and the President inside, was fuming. \"Those are Texas-born Guardsmen, Byrd, not one of those bastards ought to touch one of them!\" Wallace screamed. \"I understand, sir, but they can't just let the Vandals in, they can't turn the countryside into a slaughterhouse, they're just stuck sir.\" Byrd responded. Wallace and Byrd watched together as the standoff, which had been going on for about two hours up to that point, inflated the fears and anxieties of the men.\n\nAn hour later, a breakthrough for the country occurred: the leader of the Vandals backed down as they saw the potential reinforcement of another platoon of military police. Rather than risk the gunfight, the Vandals broke apart, retreating from the potential battleground. Local, state, and federal authorities are investigating any links to the Vandals and its members. On the other side of the country, President Wallace handed his National Security Advisor a cigar to celebrate their sustained victory."

Martin Luther King Jr. stands before a wall of police, with a small army of his ilk at his back. He knows he's lost today, that they won't let him protest in the National Mall. He yells, not bothering to use his mic, \"Before I leave here today, I have only one thing to say: I am a Man.\"\n\nThe crowd disperses, the police lower their riot shields, and the city of Washington D.C. is once more at peace. President Wallace knows this is only the beginning, his segregation bills will not go along without incident. Returning back to the White House, he picks up the phone, ready to call the one man with the ability to stop this Civil Rights movement before it can truly gain steam."

The radicals in this movement seem to think that even the Yankee states aren't going far enough and advocate armed resistance against any pereceived discrimination and police brutality. In spite of how fringe and radical this revolutionary ideology should be to all reasonable people, this movement has been gaining members and new local chapters at a worrying pace, as your support among the general population and recent policies have given grounds to radical groups among the urban ghetto communities. Most worrying of all is the mass acquisition of arms by Black Panther groups and the practice of \"open carrying\" of firearms by black power militants, a practice that appears to be little more than an effort to provoke a violent incident."

During the meeting, Hoover described the COINTELPRO FBI program, which was started in the last decade to counteract harmful movements suspected of Japanese or German ties or otherwise dangerous political goals, and suggested expanding it to disrupt groups like the Panthers and neutralize their leaders through inflitration and targeted harassment.\nThe Black Panthers and other leftist radicals have grown to be a major problems and there is much reason to worry that they will develop into a real danger if allowed to grow. If the Republican-Democrat Presidents before him allowed for such a program to be created there is no reason why President Wallace wouldn't do the same to destroy his even greater line of enemies. With that said, Hoover himself could very well be considered an enemy of Wallace as a man firmly entrenched in the old Republican-Democrat establishment, and giving him this much freedom to attack and harass members of the President's own party might prove to be more trouble than it is worth."

While few within the NPP would claim to be close with Yockey publicly, members of the NPP Congressional delegation have privately urged the Wallace administration to investigate the attempted assassination quickly in order to calm tensions within the pact and to deprive Yockey's faction any more political oxygen.\n\nUnfortunately, we already suspect who's behind all of this, and what's worse, we can't do anything about it.

Some of them were poor, and would find it difficult to justify their presence in the neighborhood; others were members of the city's moneyed and political elite, and would find it difficult to justify their presence at such a gathering at all. But they sympathized with the effort to keep the black population of America disenfranchised, by any means necessary, up to and including murder: and for that, the Ku Klux Klan opened its arms to them.\n\nThe discussion turned to the matter at hand: how to stop the 'civil rights' lunatics from making their idiotic march from Selma to Montgomery. How could the Klan send them a message that they would never be welcome in the South? There would be celebrities in attendance, alongside the wicked King and his lackeys: Joan Baez, Harry Belafonte, Tony Bennett. They couldn't count on the state police to ambush the marchers like they had at the Edmund Pettus Bridge.\n\nSo they would be more discreet: wait until dusk, then pick off the stragglers surrounding the main body of the march, each and every night. Fear would do the rest as the dead bodies began to accumulate in ditches.\n\nThe designated notekeeper dutifully recorded the details of the plan, impressing upon the remaining Klansmen that yes, they'd better make sure the rest of their compatriots were on the same page. And as the last of the assembly disappeared into the night, he dialed his own pre-agreed number."

He, and three other hooded Klansmen, were chasing another car, with two people inside, a white woman and a black man, that they had spotted fueling up after the civil rights marchers from Selma to Montgomery had begun to settle in for the night.\n\nThe Klansmen whooped, pushing their car as close to the other car as they dared. One of the Klansmen retrieved a pistol from the glovebox and shot two rounds into the rear windshield of the car ahead. The car made a sickening swerve into the center of the road, crossing the centerline, before veering back and careening into the dirt off the road. The Klansmen cried victory, and celebrated by unloading round after round into the disabled vehicle, whose windows were soon smeared red with the blood, spurting forth from every wound.\n\nAs the Klansmen drove away, they failed to notice the black man pull himself out of the ruined vehicle, his own blood indistinguishable from that of his late companion, her body ripped apart. He would wait in indescribable agony for several minutes, until he was retrieved by a passing pastor, who would tell the story of the Klansman's latest murder to an outraged public."

The mayor of Oakland has declared a state of emergency and has requested the Governor of California to deploy the National Guard to augment stretched police resources, which was approved earlier today.\n\nPresident Wallace, when asked about the developing situation, expressed his faith in the FBI to investigate, alongside local law enforcement, the circumstances surrounding the death of Newton.

Didn't Fuentes realize that his obstinance would leave his people behind? He could scream about self-determination all he wanted, but progress would not wait for him. The Guatemalans would realize America was doing them a favor, and they would damn well like it."

Wallace, President of the United States\n\nAs the world grows closer and closer to the brink of destruction, whether it be the Germans crucifying the peoples of Europe or the Japanese scourging Asia, we, as a human race, have suffered. In response, the government of the Republic of India would like to extend its genuine thanks and praise towards the government of the United States of America in extending its efforts to resolve matters and conflict with their cruel rivals, the Empire of Japan, in a way that does not involve further blood to be spilt into the seas. The people of India are tired from the continuous encroachment of Japanese army, naval, and aviation units throughout the Pacific and directly from the lands of the Chinese. However, although the meetings would guarantee a commitment from the people of India, and may result in the production of international treaty involving the nation of India, it ought to be forewarned that the Indian people value their newfound independence and freedom. Thus, if the representatives of the Indian people feel as though the terms do not represent the greater interests of the Indian nation, they will be immediately rescinded and the productions from the conference shall not include India and her people.\n\nMany thanks for your invitation to the conferences at Perth,\n\nThe government of the Indian nation\"\n\n\"My God, Fulbright, we did it, India's going to Perth!\" Wallace nearly screamed, invigorated by their diplomatic victory.

With stark reminders of the tragedies of modern history apparent through the scarred Pacific, leadership within the New Zealand government has come to the conclusion that it is more than necessary for the governments of our two nations and beyond to attempt to piece together a strengthening of our alliance in the nature of economics and trade protections. The nations of the world need to be reminded as to the greatness, potential, and prosperity offered in the realm of democracy and a free market, and with the planning of a Pacific Trading Zone to secure such ideals, New Zealand would be a proud attendant of the conferences occurring at Perth. While the peoples spread across the Pacific live in fear under the mandates produced by the harsh nature of Japan's domination in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, New Zealanders seek to promise for themselves and for others a brighter future than ever thought before.\n\nWith justice and freedom in mind,\n\nKeith Holyoake, Prime Minister over the people of New Zealand\"\n\nPresident Wallace saw within the small paragraph on the statement the ideals of the Perth Conference forming. Of a future for a democratic economy. A safe and secure future, without the threat of Japanese incursion any longer.

Wallace, President of the United States:\n\nYour proposal to unite nation's surrounding the Japanese sphere of influence is as respectable as it is outreaching for your country. Throughout the Co-Prosperity Sphere, innumerable cases of suffering produced from the actions of the Japanese military and government have occurred, and it is unfortunate to have to bear witness to these atrocities at such a close distance as the Indian government must. However, an escalation of conflict with the Empire of the Japanese would produce subsequent conflicts, with the people of the Republic of India in front in such occurrences. Such a possibility is not within the grasp of the Indian nation's interests, and a coalition of economic value in an effort to bring together the members of the Organization of Free Nations possibly resorting to a loss of profit in an already ailing global economy would produce suffering for a great number of the Indian population. We simply cannot allow the risks to disrupt our promises to the Indian people of a free and independent future with such ties, and thus, we will not be attending the conferences occurring at Perth, nor the results of such conferences.\n\nWith Peace and Prosperity in mind,\n\nThe Government of the Indian nation.\"\n\n\"Damnit.

Even if it sweetens the deal for the Aussies and Kiwis, it's not as if they need roads, hospitals, or other public infrastructure that they can't fund themselves. Much of the proposal now sitting on Wallace's desk simply distributes bloc grants to the Australian and New Zealand government, operated and disbursed at their discretion.\n\nWallace scratched his head.

Arguing that the national governments of Central America have 'capacity constraints' that prevent the adequate (or uncorrupt) distribution of funding for infrastructure projects, the proposed development package places outsize importance on American corporates with a long presence in Central America, particularly the United Fruit Company and Castle & Cooke. The two companies dominate the economies of the region and their export of agricultural produce, owning shipping, transportation, and media throughout much of Central America.\n\nWallace was a business friendly politician, to be sure, but achieving a leveling of international trade through reduced tariffs was an entirely different beast from further entrenching the dominance of American monopolies in the Caribbean. If nothing else, the outsize role played by United Fruit and Castle & Cooke would squeeze out other Americans looking to expand into Central America..."

It mixes a desperate need for infrastructure with a dearth of local private capital to fund it, leaving the massive bill squarely with the American government and taxpayer.\n\nWallace could hear the pundits screaming for blood when faced with the potential cost of winning West India's participation in the Perth Agreement.

The legal details were labyrinthine in complexity, but at heart, Washington wanted to ensure that American firms would not be subject to frivolous legal disputes from governments - or expropriation - without due compensation.\n\nWhile Australia and New Zealand might back the proposal, given their robust private sectors and comparable legal framework to the U.S., the Central American nations were a different matter. The dominating presence of United Fruit and other conglomerates in their economies was a matter considerable controversy among the citizenry, and the conglomerates spent enormous sums protecting their interests.\n\nThe clause in the Perth Agreement would, hopefully, put American firms at ease; and for that reason, the negotiating team expected pushback from Central America's socialist governments.

And thus, the President journeyed, side by side with key members of his staff, and even his wife, Lurleen. The South, the President's home, was a goldmine for support of such an act, and it was just a matter of time until they'd get the work done.\n\nThe campaign trail formed a circle around the entire South, allowing them to quickly hop from capital to capital in an effort to make sure everyone knew of the importance of repealing that damned civil rights act! The President's journey began in D.C. itself, where the President captured the attention of the public in his announcement of his journey to win over the hearts of the people so that never again would they be burdened by unnecessary legislation like that ridiculous \"Civil Rights Act.\" Next, the President traveled out west, from West Virginia to Missouri, before heading southwards to the farmlands of Texas, where crowds cried out to meet the President and his wife, and more importantly for Wallace, tune in to the unfairness held by the Civil Rights Act. The crowning jewel of the trip was when he reached back home at Montgomery, Alabama after heading eastward, where he dined in the city hall among some of the powerful southern senators, representatives, and governors in a televised event broadcasted to drive the people of America to get their Senators to vote for repeal! Finally, Wallace journeyed up the Eastern Seaboard until finally concluding the trip back in the nation's capital, Washington D.C. There, marching bands and cannons greeted the President as he drove in, along with the thousands of southerners who had crowded the front of the White House. There, the President rose to a high up podium to deliver a fiery speech regarding \"the beauty that is the green jewel of the Southern United States!\" before returning to the theme of his journey, \"to get on the asses of your senators and representatives and tell them: repeal that damned act! For your freedom, for your liberty, for your independence!\" Wallace's screams dominated the area, giving rise to the thunderous applause of the southerners who came to witness the sensation.\n\nThat evening, President Wallace took but a little while to relax and enjoy himself, thanking his wife for going with him the whole way and making it such a nice trip."

As he was enjoying himself, a knock at the door interrupted the President's breakfast, calling \"Come in!\" with a full mouth to work with. Curtis LeMay entered the Oval Office, saying \"Sorry about the interruption, Mr. President, though we are going to have to start getting work to figure the rest of the campaign out.\" Wallace nodded while fruitlessly attempting to wipe the syrup off his face.\n\n\"Mr. President, we received outstanding support for the campaign within the South, reports indicate that approval ratings regarding the repeal have jumped tremendously from before. However, this is where things get difficult: we have a choice from here.\" LeMay said, while pointing to the map ahead of him. President Wallace inspected the map, noting that while they covered the entirety of the south, it wouldn't be enough to get the repeal they needed. No. They needed to expand. The next two areas were certainly not going to be easy to get through, as their options looked to be the Northeastern United States or heading out Westward. \"You see, we have some issues here, LeMay. The Northeast has some strong liberal shitheads around the region, each one of them constantly pissing themselves whining about 'President Wallace and his racism.' The plus side is that the area is some of the least ground to cover, meaning that if we hit it and hit hard, everyone in there is going to hear it and get it drilled into them. On the other side, over in the West, they're a little bit, what's the word, uh, fickle. They could be swayed with a little bit of hammering hard, the problem is that it's a whole helluva lot of ground to cover, meaning a lot of resources and a lot of time. And, if worse comes to worse, a lot of time spent on a loss.\"\n\nThe President and his running map looked over the map carefully, looking at the benefits and problems of each trip.

This is just about our last stop on the trip, and we need to decide where to go from here, sir.\" LeMay's words delivered a sense of remembrance and happiness over the past few days, feeling proud as his words branded Americans with a simple request: repeal! Wallace had to shake himself out of his daydream as he took another look at the map. \"Well, uh, what's your ideas, sir?\" LeMay asked, seeming unsure, which Wallace thought was usual by this point. \"Well, LeMay, the way I see it, we've got another two options: this time between the Rust Belt or the Great Plains of the good ole' USA.\" Wallace said, nodding his head. \"Both of these places are losing thousands of people a year, LeMay, let's make that clear; so, no matter what, we're going to have to hit precisely and accurately if we want our voice heard. The Rust Belt is historical for having a helluva lotta working Americans and political force behind it. Meanwhile, the Great Plains is known for its 'representation of the country's beauty' or whatever the fuck, giving it that good American look with some country folk who may feel happy to listen up to the possibility of getting that damned Civil Rights Act out of their hair that's plaguing what little business they have. Either way, we're going to have to spend a lot of resources in making our voices known out there.\"\n\nA flight attendant came nearing the President and the Vice President, offering a bright smile before saying in a thick southern drawl, \"Please, sirs, the plane's going to be descending soon, I'd like to ask you both to watch yourselves so you don't get hurt if things get bumpy.\""

Whilst the President tours the journey in an effort to raise support for the repeal of the Civil Rights Act in order to push further along in segregation policy, the legislative branch bickers and argues once more over the President's actions.\n\nIn particular, reports indicate that a small leak from within the office of the President made its way to the Senate floor, where it alleged that alleged that President Wallace had been in direct contact with a variety of law-makers for the country and manipulating them to vote alongside him in the upcoming vote which prompted the nationwide tour the President is currently engaged on. In particular, the source was unsure as to whether the President was employing payments to bribe the senators into following his footsteps in the vote or if he had collected controversial information regarding the senators and threatening to publically leak the information to secure their vote; however, the leak emphasized that the manner in which the corruption was happening didn't matter, so much as though that it was happening in the first place. News teams are spread across the capital attempting to record information in regards to the chaos on Capitol Hill, but no matter what, the people present around Washington D.C. can feel the air tighten all across the city.\n\nOne senator declared that if the President really had been resorting to such acts that he be \"removed from office with all due haste for tampering with the legal process.\" Only time may tell what will happen to the President."

The senator was dismissed from duties as he awaits a federal trial on grounds of bribery and corruption for his acts of attempting to force votes towards the repealing of the Civil Rights Act. Nevertheless, the actions of the senator does not seem to have slowed down the journey of the President as he travels across the countryside in an effort to earn the hearts and minds of Americans in an effort to repeal the same act which caused the controversy within the senate in the first place. Finally, Americans can get some rest after the momentous shocks that came from Washington these past few days, and instead, can prepare as the vote to repeal the Civil Rights Act comes closer and closer. This has been Howard Reig, with NBC Nightly News, signing off and wishing Americans across the country a goodnight!\"\n\nWallace collapsed into the bed he was sitting up in.

 wallace.impeachment.33.desc:0 "首席大法官面对参议院里的众人，大声宣布：“正式投票已经收集完毕，等待核验，投票结果将会决定乔治·华莱士总统是否有罪。”华莱士总统内心五味杂陈，有恐惧，有愤怒，还有因绝望而产生的悲哀。在他身边，他的辩护律师个个坐立不安，除了萨多夫斯基博士。萨多夫斯基现在神情恍惚，但最终，他俩都清清楚楚地听到了两个音节：“有罪”，跟着的是一连串数字，之后又是一遍，“有罪”。\n\n听到这个词从首席大法官肥硕的唇间蹦出，总统华莱士，或者说，前总统华莱士的心“咯噔”一下，他不由得低下头，盯着面前的桌子。美利坚合众国的总统在参众两院发起的审判后被免职，这在历史上还是头一次。怎么会变成这样，是因为这场灾难的过程中缺乏沟通吗？审判结束了，参议院的人群也已散去，前总统华莱士被护送出了参议院大楼。门外，则是整个美国的缩影——一半的人群欢呼着，庆祝弹劾的成功，另一半人则沉默无声，似乎为华莱士的失败而崩溃不已。白宫里，一些人忙着收拾前总统的个人物品，试图扫除他在白宫中的影响。华莱士与他最亲密的内阁成员一一握手，但却不敢面对剩下的那些曾把他视为领袖的人。他是乔治·C·华莱士总统，是国民派的领导者，是现代美国政界的强人，他曾决心让美国焕然一新，如今却被赶出了白宫。在白宫里的最后时刻，他与即将成为总统的柯蒂斯·李梅握手，他是华莱士的副总统，也是并肩战斗过的伙伴。之后，他和妻子勒琳·华莱士一起，回到了阿拉巴马的家中。\n\n阿拉巴马州蒙哥马利市的家中，乔治和勒琳躺在床上，看着李梅总统的宣誓。“我宣誓，作为美利坚合众国的总统，我会在职责范围内纠正华莱士政府的错误，弥补国家的裂痕。我希望我可以成为一个比前总统华莱士更受欢迎的总统。”华莱士关掉了电视机，翻身睡了过去。"

 wallace.433.desc:0 "It is just as we feared. As the Senate sat down to begin the final debates and vote on the PFTA, one RDC senator skipped up to the stand with a determined twinkle in his eye. He began to speak - and continued to speak - and would not stop speaking for a very, very long time.\n\n\"My fellow senators. This is a very important day for our country, no doubt. But before we hold this critical vote, I believe we need to discuss what really matters. I come before you today to speak about a subject very dear to my heart...\"\n\nIt became immediately clear that this was indeed a filibuster. Rather than focus on the matter at hand, the senator began a lengthy reading of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, his favorite book from his youth. Despite the ridiculousness of the situation, filibuster is of course a protected practice. His voice was clear and driven, and at no point did he falter, leave for the bathroom or do anything that could bring the filibuster to an end. Even worse, lain out in front of him was a myriad of other reading material - it was clear that he was in this for the long haul.\n\nAside from giving in to the filibuster, we have two main courses of action. We could attempt to call a cloture vote - a vote to end the filibuster and immediately ratify the agreement. However, this requires us to secure a two-thirds majority. As time goes on, more and more people will be eager to see this filibuster come to a close, so an alternative is to wait it out until we can be sure we have enough support for a cloture vote to pass."

With the more arduous potential of endless debate, amendment and the dreaded filibuster swept aside, the preparations for the vote on the PFTA can now go ahead without any impediment by Congess.\n\nA cheerful President Wallace spoke with uncharacteristic candor to the assembled journalists on Capitol Hill, promising that with the bill fast tracked he would do everything he can to bring about the establishment of the free trade zone as soon as possible. While this is not the final victory and the actual vote still needs to be secured, that the Senate agreed to the fastrack may serve as a positive indicator to the chances for the bill itself."
 bill_2_failed:0 "Bitter groans emerged from Wallace's allies on the Congress floor today, as the proposal to fastrack the Perth Free Trade Agreement fell short of a majority. While this does not spell the end for the bill, it means that it will now continue to be debated by Congress, with the potential for a long lasting argument or the addition of amendments that may modify or dilute its intended purpose.\n\nPresident Wallace is reportedly furious at the news, knowing that many of his rivals in Congress would love nothing more than to see one of his crowning achievements strangled in the cot. Indeed, there are a few of these antagonistic individuals who will likely stop at nothing to prevent the bill's passing, utilizing everything in the rulebook including that time-old American tradition - the fillibuster."

How do we possibly move on from this? How can this possibly be anything other than a colossal failure for my presidency?\"\n\nThe Perth Free Trade Agreement was delivered its sentence today, as the Senate finally dismissed the proposal. With the Bloc dead in the water, the delegations of the other nations have already begun leaving Perth to return home, quietly cursing the wasted effort. President Wallace has not been seen in public since the defeat, as he seethes over the tarnishing of his economic magnum opus.\n\nMuch of the opposition to the bill came from within the NPP, with much of the Progressives and even some of the more protectionist Right coming out to cast their votes against it. In the eyes of the voters, the failure of the NPP to come together to pass a measure that was already widely unpopular amongst a large amount of the general public has only further exposed the fractures in the pact. The optics of this defeat for the NPP are certainly grave indeed."
 bill_5_passed:0 "At long last, after many weeks of negotiations, backroom deals and bitter arguments, the Senate today formally approved the Perth Free Trade Agreement, which was promptly signed into law by President Wallace. In Perth itself, the delegations present were finally able to ratify the Perth Bloc into an official institution of free trade across the Pacific and beyond.\n\nIt will take some time for the effects of the free trade zone to be felt. Major international corporations are currently in feverish talks with foreign governments and businesses to organize deals and expansion into overseas markets. There are already some promising signs, however, with the Dollar surging on the stock exchange as the markets respond positively to this historic development. The opportunities now open to American business are vast, and many business executives are currently occupying themselves with champagne and celebrations.\n\nAmerica is sure to gain much influence over the Pacific from the agreement, which will surely help beat back the grip of the Rising Sun. Though many of our voters are still leery over the impact of the PFTA, they will surely see the benefits soon. This is a great day for American business, and for the National Progressive Pact."

From the very impetus of her campaign for President, Smith has openly advertised herself as \"pro-business\"- a political position destined to gain wide traction in terms of monetary support, no doubt. However, the presidency itself comes with caveats, one of which is that campaign promises are often only half-fulfilled.\n\nThe Progressives, the general progressive party of the United States, begrudgingly supported Smith during her presidential campaign, and now expects her to support their pro-laborer demands. Under their leadership, and with the support of the Smith Administration, the Progressives could unravel the President's business support, killing her chances at re-election. If she is to maintain her popularity, she will have to walk the tightrope between worker welfare and business support."

This remains true for the contemporary United States. For the past 3 decades, wages have risen only slightly in comparison to the increase in cost of living and decrease in the value of the dollar. Consequently, economic progressivism has seen a massive resurgence in the Progressives and other groups, and they have become so vocal about their rhetoric that they are now impossible to ignore.\n\nPresident Margaret Chase Smith is famously pro-employer, but should she wish to pass some of her legislation, she must gain the support of the Progressives. As outright pushing for pro-employee policies is out of the question, the President believes that better relations between businesses and laborers is the most effective and prudent solution to the problem. With the empowerment of the National Labor Relations Board, the employer-employee system may see improvement."

In almost 200 years of existence, the economy has been seldom worse. More than 20% of Americans live in poverty, according to the US Census Bureau; the nation's GDP has seen stagnant growth since the end of the Second World War, far less than would be expected; hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Americans lack access to basic necessities, such as clean drinking water. All-in-all, the United States of America is in bad shape.\n\nLuckily for the States, however, it has a President and congress who mostly recognize the issue, and are willing to do anything to put an end to it. While President Margaret Chase Smith wants most Americans to have access to welfare programs that would allow the poor and infirm to get back on their feet, she also knows that the federal budget could not allow for massive expansion of welfare. As such, the President and her allies in Congress will attempt to push through a new federal budget to cut back on wasteful projects and allocate the excess funding to a new welfare program; one that would primarily assist those who cannot assist themselves."

 USA_mcs_68_maternity_leave_desc:0 "One of the most important things for an infant is the familial connection: the bond formed with the father and mother. Yet, for decades, women have been refused leave from work to care for their child following birth. For such a crucial time in infantile development, precious little attention is given to it by the law. While it is true that some employers will allow new mothers to take perhaps a few unpaid days or weeks off work to care for their child, many do not. Consequently, many new moms are either forced to leave their children at home with a babysitter while they work- an increasingly expensive proposition- or take their infants to work with them, where they put immense stress on their mothers.\n\nAs most politicians are male, relatively few are more aware of this problem than President Margaret Chase Smith. She knows better than most that women not only deserve maternity leave, but require it. Raising a new generation is neither easy nor cheap, and thus, the President will press state legislatures to pass laws that mandate maternity leave, preferably of the paid variety."

This state of affairs cannot continue, for the sake of all those Americans forced to work long hours in poor conditions for the bare-minimum in wages, and President Smith acknowledges such.\n\nUnder the President's new economic reforms, the ability to unionize will no longer be a privilege for American workers, but an inextricable right. Previously, unionization was only protected at the state-level, with virtually no federal regulation in the matter. In her new legislation, the National Labor Relations Board would be given the authority to protect American workers' unions across state lines, greatly increasing the strength of the employees against their potentially unfair employers."

At the time being, the best we can do is grant economic security to the most low-income of people in American society; the blind, disabled, and those who have to provide for others, like single mothers.\n\nIn her most recent bill in a long but unfinished list, President Smith and her Congressional allies have worked together to create the American Economic Security Act, which will guarantee financial aid for those who either cannot work or cannot support their families, namely the disabled and low-income families. It will not be a great stipend, and likely won't have a great effect on rates of homelessness and poverty, but it will be a start."

For a group of people far more likely to suffer health problems, this news is plainly unacceptable. In order to rectify the issue, the President and her allies in Congress have drafted a new bill to create a new federal program to assist the elderly: Americare.\n\nIn this new healthcare program, all Americans over the age of 65 years of age, or those suffering from serious, lifelong conditions, would become subject to government-provided health insurance. Americare would not discriminate along racial or monetary grounds either, with full coverage regardless of race, gender, income, or other factors.

As young, unschooled children are at a very important developmental stage of their lives, having poor familial connection is devastating. To ensure the health of our working mothers, as well as the future generation of Americans they are raising, President Margaret Chase Smith has proposed greatly lessening the financial strain that children place upon their parents. This would be achieved through extreme cuts to taxes upon single mothers who work full-time, increased social security with less extreme benefits given to low-income families in which both parents are employed."

While many government laws over the past hundred years have tried to increase safety in the American workplace, these have been few and far between.\n\nHowever, due to extensive, somewhat-bipartisan campaigning and President Smith's cooperation with the Progressives, this standard may be ready to change. The President and her allies in Congress have penned the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, for short. It would provide for the establishment of a new federal agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which will cooperate with workers' unions and health experts to determine which workplace practices are safe, and which are not. In order to ensure business compliance, OSHA guidelines are not just advisory, but mandatory, with violators severely fined.

 USA_mcs_68_subsidies_or_the_state_desc:0 "There are two principal ways that the government may implement its planned healthcare and welfare reforms: insurance subsidies, or state-provided insurance. In the former, preferred by the President and most conservatives in Congress, the United States government would heavily subsidize insurance companies across America to keep medical expenses for the individual relatively low. This option is not without its downsides, however; these insurance companies are still businesses, and thus are primarily for-profit, so there will still be a not-insignificant price-tag.\n\nIn a state-provided system, supported mainly by the Progressives and liberal elements of Congress, the government itself would be the primary care provider, with tax income serving as the payment method. This system would almost completely eliminate the cost of medical care for the patient. However, it would also cost significantly more, and lead to a massive increase in federal spending. It also runs the risk of angering private insurance companies, who may not take kindly to free, state-provided healthcare."

Less fortunate groups, namely women and minorities, face great discrimination in the hiring process. In short, if a white woman, a black man, and a white man all apply for the same job opening, the white man will be given the position nine times out of ten. President Smith recognizes that this issue more than most politicians, and as such, will campaign for legislation which would prevent employment discrimination.\n\nTo this end, the bill, known as the Equal Employment Rights Act, will create a federal commission which will oversee employment equality across the country. Should a business be reported for potential discrimination or the commission suspects there is, the commission will be able to sue the offending business and punish them in a court of law."

President Smith's recent economic reforms have sought to rectify the long-standing issues which the Unions have pined over for decades. With many of their primary complaints addressed, thousands of formerly-incensed workers are now leaving their unions, weakening them to a great degree, and pleasing both the President and her business allies.

These reforms will likely be extremely helpful to the poor of the nation, but there is still quite a bit of fat that remains to be trimmed in the budgeting department. Consequently, the President has chosen several low-priority, high-expense parts of the bills to be amended with additional legislation that will cut back on spending.\n\nThese cost-limiting bills will unfortunately but unavoidably weaken the effect that the new national welfare system will have on poverty. As a result, the President can anticipate having a harder time passing them through Congress, as many progressive congressmen will believe them too austere and harmful."

To remedy this problem, the President has proposed that many of the old taxes and regulations upon the medical sector be repealed.

Most women were expected to get married and raise children while their husbands provided for them. As they had no intention of choosing a lifelong career or profession, not many attended college.\n\nNow, this status quo is being challenged as more and more women begin to seek higher education and white-collar jobs. This \"Quiet Revolution\"- so called because of how the change has gone relatively unnoticed by society at large- represents a fundamental change in how women view themselves and their place in the world.

Doctors are being paid less while having to care for an increased volume of newly-insured patients. In short, it is becoming less worthwhile to pursue a career in medicine, as paying off med school debts becomes more and more difficult.\n\nTo rectify this issue for future doctors and nurses, the President has proposed a new federal program of medical scholarships, that would greatly decrease financial strain on young men and women studying medicine. In addition, it would encourage more individuals to pursue a medical career in the first place, as the price-tag becomes more approachable."

USDA secretary Earl Butz has been complaining about being asked to intervene though, he seems to consider it below him to argue individual farm conditions, especially over a \"20 cent dispute\" as he calls it.

As a member of the pro-business faction, he's already troublesome enough. Should we have to remove him for whatever reason, it would be very hard to cajole them into cooperating with our plan.

Still, Harlow was worried about Butz putting his foot in his mouth again, so he asked the undersecretary to review Butz' recent meetings. He discovered that in a statement he made to the representatives of the grape-using company Schenley Industries and the DiGiorgio Corporations, he called the strikers \"a buncha half-baked degoes looking to fill whatever pockets they haven't already filled with stolen grapes, with whatever cash they can extort from local growers.\" If the press catches even the slightest whiff of this, not only will the Delano strikers be furious and refuse to work with us, but the entire party could fall apart even if we don't lose the entire Hispanic vote first!

The one we've chosen as new AgriSec is Orville Freeman, a committed moderate progressive with mild progressive leanings. He's a military veteran, so the right will hopefully not instantly hate him, while still being far enough left that he qualifies as part of the Progressives.

The two only begrudgingly agreed on actively resisting Japan, which the RDC paid plenty of lip service to anyway.\n\nAs party divisions escalated openly going into the midterms, Smith - whose tenure in Washington, orthodox economics, and Maine liberalism could open doors across the Pact - had sat the two factions down. She'd flatly warned that their squabbles were hemorrhaging support for the NPP, unless they put their differences aside behind a novel candidate - Smith herself. Wallace and Harrington had grudgingly agreed, if only because the alternative was the political wilderness.\n\nBut now that Smith had won the White House, in defiance of political gravity in the NPP, reality would soon come crashing back down. And although Smith has her own ambitions - in labor, healthcare, women's rights, and the fight against Japan - none of them would matter if the NPP went up in smoke."

The expressions of everyone else in the room tightened instantly. Smith smiled; of course everybody knew the story of how one of the major political parties of the pre-Civil War era had imploded, fracturing under the weight of its own contradictions concerning the great question of its day - slavery.\n\n\"I'm not saying that the NPP is going the way of the Whigs, but with Wallace on our right and Harrigton to the left, we're not too far from that scenario either.\" Smith paused, letting the room absorb the magnitude of the task at hand. \"The papers are saying that having a woman in the Oval Office is history in its own right. But any President is judged by the legacy they leave behind, and I refuse to have this administration be a footnote to the divisions in our own party!\""

Flanked only by the deputies of the NPP's Progressive and Marxist caucuses, the President had the audacity to declare, presumably without consulting her colleagues to the right, that the government would make \"the addressing of economic inequality and the cause of civil justice\" a priority.'\n\n'By all means, we welcome measures aimed at addressing the plight of the rural poor and disadvantaged. Our readers know many in need of such help. But we must ask, in the name of good and decent government, whether government funds will be productively used; that is, whether we are teaching a man to fish, or simply handing them a fish.

But now here they were, two creatures of differing political camps in need of each other.\n\nSmith opened the meeting. \"Mr. Harrington, you know as well as I do that the NPP is being pulled apart between the Progressives and the Nationalists. And if we're going to get anything done in the next four years, I need at least one of the two to support legislation in Congress.\"\n\n\"Believe me, the Progressives are more than happy to help, just as we have on civil rights in the past.\" Harrington replied brightly, before pausing.\n\n\"I assume there's a 'but' coming?\" Smith said.\n\nHarrington nodded. \"My colleagues and I joined the NPP to have a shot at reforms for the working class - real reforms, not just the kind of band-aid fixes proposed by the RDC and opposed by the Nationalists.

She had hoped, against the evidence, that the Army would retain a semblance of professionalism. These hopes were now dashed, as Chief of Staff Bryce Harlow's investigation into the leaks tormenting her Administration had identified Brigadier General Alexander Haig as the link between the Army and the press, distributing the key memos linking John Stennis to the Navy's segregation debacle.\n\nResigning in protest, and then loudly complaining about it, was a time-honored tradition, and President Smith had resigned herself to dealing with the fallout of Stennis' mismanagement of the Army. But this level of trickery? It was behavior she'd come to expect from the RDC - but not from an Army looking to do an end-run around their President.\n\nHer hands shook gently as she took her reading glasses off, chewing on the arms in a quiet fury. If the Army wanted to play with fire, then they could burn: she could publicly axe General Haig, making an example of him to the cheers of the NPP. At the same time, she could imagine the fury that would inspire in the remaining Army staff, even if they got the message. Would satisfying her fury be worth it?"

He'd even gone so far as to advertise his 'good offices', if the President needed 'somebody to smooth things over with the Army.'\n\n\"I've had enough of this,\" President Smith muttered, before slamming Harlow's investigation file onto the desk. \"Read the first page aloud, General Haig. Tell me all about your friends in the press and on Capitol Hill.\"\n\nHaig fell silent. He didn't pick up the papers.\n\n\"I don't care that you don't respect me; I'm not here to win your vote.\" President Smith said testily. \"But if you can't respect the office of the Commander in Chief - if you can't pick up a piece of paper when I tell you to - then you need to get out.\"\n\nAnother few seconds of silence. \"You have until noon tomorrow, if you want to go quietly.

The Army officials at the hearing noticeably bristled in their seats. Some looked to the RDC members of the committee to offer them some cover.\n\nNone did.

The Japanese have paid greatly in blood in uprooting the foreigner from the land they exploit, and this effort will not be in vain. To have American naval presence in the South China Sea would be considered an insult to all those who gave their lives to the liberation of Asia, the countless tombs in the depths of the Pacific would be disgraced as soon as the approval is given.

Finally, Smith can claim that with her Presidency, she was destined to reclaim America's time in the sun, a time of glory, of victory, of success.\n\nBut, would it be that way? As the hours continued, she heard horrific reports of the aerial battles over Australia, as increasing amounts of American aircraft are shot out of the sky, until they reach their graves below, coated in fuel, fire, and blood. Land forces were ordered to mobilize and prepare for a full on invasion plan of the Pacific Islands, as various leading generals yelled at one another over competing battle plans and how to finally bring down the Japanese Empire, in their minds. On top of it all, the Seventh fleet reported that they're prepared to regroup, but the Japanese look to be preparing a counterattack, one which could decimate the fleet if they do not get the reinforcements they need out there. The Pacific was on fire, and the inferno was only spreading, as the Final Pacific War had begun! The United States refused to back down after its citizens deaths, for their pride, their honor, for Stennis!\n\nHowever, past all of the reports, drawings of battle plans, organizations of armies, and commands issued to navies, one thought dominated President Margaret Chase Smith's mind.\n\nHow launch codes for the nuclear arsenal of the United States was easily accessible in a briefcase near her, and her late husband's portrait she woke up to just days ago."

She had dealt with years of work in both houses of the United States Congress, a true crisis was bound to happen one day in her career, right?\n\nEdwin Walker stepped into the room, interrupting the President's inner thoughts, and as the President raised her head with a face of iron, she was met with a reserved smile across the room. \"Mrs. President, the Prime Minister of Japan has decided to respectfully comply and meet with our demands. He is in the process of putting together a speech to recognize the Imperial Japanese Army's accidental shooting down of Mr. Stennis's aircraft, and is allowing complete access of the United States Navy to attempt to search for the wreckage, in order to 'alleviate tensions.' It appears as though you have managed to scare the Japanese off, Madam President.\"\n\n\"Don't thank me, Ed, thank yourself and the cabinet.\" The President said, reaching to the phone to assemble her administration."

It appears that the Prime Minister has signaled that they do not wish to press the issue forward any longer, and 'seeing that tensions are high with the President' as he put it, has decided to grant access to the American Navy into the South China Sea to search for the wreckage, and hopefully recover Secretary of Defense Stennis. How should we proceed?\"\n\nA slow smile crept across the President's face. After all that the Japanese had done to her country, her administration had finally gotten the Empire to take a few steps back. \"Bryce, route me to Secretary Chafee, the Navy will find this wreckage, and bring the citizens aboard back home.\""

Finally, there was a knock at the door, General Maxwell Taylor, the soon-to-be Secretary of Defense, stood in the President's door.\n\n\"Ma'am, there's been some progress. The Japanese Government has allowed their barring of the United States Navy to stand, but has rescinded any enforcement, allowing us to go in without challenge of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Shall we proceed?\" The advisor stated. \"Christ, we did it.\" The President said with a sigh of relief, sitting down as she brought her eyes back to General Taylor. \"Alert Secretary Chafee that we are to proceed with the search, and to direct the Seventh fleet into the South China Sea to begin looking.\" \"Right away, ma'am.\" Taylor said, before exiting the room.\n\nSmith took a moment to turn and stand, looking outwards into Washington D.C. through the windows of her office.

Until finally, after several phone calls, she received the exact one she was looking for. \"Secretary Chafee, what is there to report?\" Chafee uttered a long sigh before answering.\n\n\"Madam President, the Fleet Admiral reports that it appears as though the Japanese fleet is breaking formation and turning back.\"\n\nSmith's minds echoed words of thanks as she managed to let out a sigh of gratitude, after barely being able to breathe. \"Continue as ordered, Secretary Chafee, and make sure that fleet is ready for anything out there, but we need to find those bodies.\" Smith ordered. After the click of the phone line, Secretary Walker came in, looking equally as exhausted. \"Madam President, the Prime minister has made an official statement to withdraw the Imperial Japanese Navy from their blockade and return to port.

Her goals, her efforts to unite the Pact was crumbling. Her efforts to make the NPP more than just the unending opposition to the Republican-Democrats, to turn it into an actual option for the American people, was falling apart.\n\nAgnew spread his hands as he stood in front of the desk, and took a deep breath. \"I think we should make our positions clear, Madam President.

But they also need to know that loyalty is a two way street.\"\n\nSmith leaned forward in her chair. \"What are you suggesting?\"\n\nl \"A declaration, a party message.

But, at the same time, if you stand against the decision, if you break ranks, if you leave, then you are on your own. We won't help you.

All this, while letting the Republican-Democrats lean back and watch the fireworks, occasionally throwing a bit more gasoline on the fire when they finally got the chance to stand up and speak at the podium. Journalists were loving every second of it. Newspapers were going wild with the stories that were coming out. Only TV networks, without film footage from a still camera shy Congress, were restrained from turning the Congress into a pay-per-view wrestling match.\n\n\"What are you suggesting, Spiro?\" President Smith said. She still was determined, and resolute, but she knew when she needed assistance. All her years in the House and Senate never prepared her for this. That's where the Vice President came in.\n\nAgnew was sitting on one of the couches in the center of the room, right above the carpeted Presidential Seal, legs crossed. \"We just need some more time.

With the spirit of Southern Hospitality, the meetings in the homes and offices of Senator Strom Thurmond, and George Wallace's hotel room in the Willard Hotel have been the scene of many a long night of drinks, smoking, and backroom politicking.\n\nEventually, the leaders of the Nationalists present Agnew with something they would want in the event of a massive bill. While the majority of the Nationalists are segregationist and would love nothing better than to roll back civil rights, that is off the table thanks to the public pressure. However, they also fought for the \"little man\" and those left behind, and so they wanted something else: a massive aid program for the South. Low or no interest loans for farmers, subsidies for new industries, and efforts to alleviate the impoverishment of the region that stretched back as far as the aftermath of the Civil War. And of course, every Senator, Representative and Governor will have their own pork barrel project: a big bridge across an uncrossed river, a contract to a local business, or some new courthouses and police stations.\n\nNow, any administration could propose such a program and most likely get it through Congress. However, the problem is that it would be massively expensive, and with all the other possible additions to the bill it could make the national debt balloon and make many deficit hawks start screaming to the heavens. So, will we play ball and add what the Nationalists wants, or try to pass the law without their support?"

One of the unofficial leaders of the Progressive wing of the National Progressive Pact, Scoop has long been a strong proponent of civil rights.\n\nWasting little time, Senator Jackson has told Agnew what his supporters in the Progressives would want in the grand compromise bill: a massive education bill, giving money to raise the standards of schools around the country. Money would be provided to refurbish and repair schools, provide new textbooks, train more teachers, hire nurses and qualified therapists, provide a robust school lunch system, improve school gymnasiums, playgrounds and other activities, and much more. This would mostly focus on schools in the inner cities of the Northeast and Midwest that have been suffering since the rise of \"white flight\" to the suburbs in the past couple of decades, which have resulted in gaps in funding and the drop of test scores and the prospects for their graduates, if they even can.\n\nSponsoring an education bill that would give a lot of money to schools around the nation is a pretty popular idea (after all, who doesn't want to help the children?), but adding it to this law will be very expensive and add a lot of red ink to the federal budget. So it's up to Vice President Agnew if he wants to add this to the bill to unify the NPP or not."

As one of the two main leaders of the Progressive wing of the National Progressive Pact, it's vital that Agnew find out what he wants to try to bring the Pact closer together.\n\nHarrington's strong support for the working class has never faltered, and his proposal to the VP is massive in scope: the establishment of a federal agency, the National Labor Relations Board, to facilitate collective bargaining and rule on unfair labor practices.\n\nThe NLRB, in Harrinington's view, would give more power to the workers and their unions, and rebalance the American economy away from the single minded efforts of wealth generation for the already rich and wealthy, but to enable safe workplaces, a living wage, and benefits for employees, and to enforce fines and penalties on companies that attempt to suppress unions. Harrington said he would like to make this new body as non-partisan as possible, so he'd be willing to have members of the Nationalists, and maybe even the RDC, to sit on it's board.\n\nWhile the idea of supporting unions and their millions of dues-paying members is a sound political strategy, and wouldn't even be horribly expensive compared to other programs and ideas members of the NPP have proposed, it would result in more costs for companies with the higher wages and increased standards required, and some of the conservative, pro-business politicians of the NPP would be loathe to support such a measure. The Vice President has to decide if the NLRB will be worth putting in to the bill."

Explicitly, cut the taxes on some of America's largest corporations, and perhaps a few of the very rich as well. After decades of mismanagement by a bloated federal government dumping the hard earned wealth of \"job creators\" and the \"engines of prosperity\" into a black hole of bureaucracy and thousands of niche programs, it's time to reward these guys and their companies with a bit of a kickback. With these new resources, they can invest back into the economy by expanding their business, hiring new workers, acquire new technology and all that good stuff that will, undoubtedly, make everyone much, much better off in the long run.\n\nIt's hard to tell how much of what Cohn is suggesting is true, that these companies need just a few million more tax-free dollars to make their companies grow even more, or if it's really just an excuse to grant even larger paychecks to the executives or dividends to the stockholders. The gap in revenue from lower corporate taxes will have effects on other parts of the federal budget that will have to be covered with raised taxes elsewhere, or even more debt.

Even if everyone had a chance to go over all the details, and debate the bill on the floor of the Senate, voting against the bill will likely result in you voting against your own best interests, both in having popular suggestions scuttled, or in having your supporters consider you a traitor, corrupted by the Washington elite.\n\nWhile not everyone got what they wanted in the bill, hopefully enough people, from enough factions of the Pact, did so that they will vote for it.

The more Progressive would hate it by definition, and there was no telling how such a move would look to the press.\n\nSmith thought back to the recent meetings she had with Itliong and Chavez. The easiest solution could be agreeing to Larry's terms; agreeing to raise the minimum wage would be seen as radical by some, but was sufficiently progressive enough to placate the Progressives without antagonizing the right too much. A peaceful, negotiated end to the strikes would have its advantages... if all the farmers agreed to it.\n\nAnd then, there was Chavez. Going along with his plan would likely elicit a violent reaction from the Nationalists; increasing pensions and reducing work hours, not just at Delano but attempting to do so nationwide, would be a showstopper for the Nationalists.

The National Guard would then be deployed only in limited numbers to protect scabs and federal workers from the strikers.\n\nA potential compromise solution, presented after the meeting by Nathan Wolkimir of the National Federation of Federal Employees and backed by the friendly union leaders Alan Whitney and John Griner, aims to split the UFPC and thus leave Rademacher's NALC as clear leaders of the strike.

The resentment had accumulated like so much dust, starting with clandestine side meetings over contentious policies, leading to arguments over committee seniority, and finally devolving to frequent committee recesses just to prevent a public walkout.\n\nAnd if the essence of leadership came from the top, the White House wasn't helping. The President no longer presided; she was partisan, and that had just added fuel to the fire. Now, even simple things were exercises in Sisyphean futility, and Jackson had to watch it all.\n\nThe two NPP 'colleagues' refused to answer Jackson's plea for unity. Sighing, Jackson looked back at his list, mostly scratched out. \"What about O'Hara? He's a lawyer, a member of the local Chamber of Commerce-\"\n\n\"No.\" The Nationalist representative cut Jackson off. \"He's NAACP; how am I selling that to Wallace?\"\n\nThe Progressive man bristled. \"So we're only running racists in the South these days?\"\n\nAs the two returned to insulting each other, Jackson crossed off yet another name in the list, and sighed. At this rate, the RDC might end up getting the seat after all."

There are less errant press conferences, and feverish walk-backs of erroneous statements. Voters are starting to come back to our rallies and town halls. The NPP, even if it remains a party divided internally, is at least taking care to no longer show those divisions as openly as it once did, and finds that the way forward in Washington is far easier for it."

The marriage between the cadres of the Progressives and the warriors of the Nationalists may be a strange one, but it is working - and crucially, the American people believe it might be a lasting one."

She eyed the newspaper roll tucked into the sauntering man's arm crook.\n\n\"Madam President,\" he said, proffering today's issue of The Washington Post. Margaret swiped it off his hands and unfurled its pages; half a second later, the newspaper flew an arc onto a switched-on paper shredder atop the Resolute Desk. With barely-repressed glee, the President watched the contraption tear Strom Thurmond's raisin-wrinkled mug, and the bold-faced words \"'PINKO-LOVING TURNCOAT': SEN. THURMOND BLASTS MCS IN SESSION\", into ribbons of day-old paper.\n\nShe turned her withering glare to Agnew, who shrugged as he dusted bits of Thurmond and libel off his lapels. \"Can't say I didn't warn you, Ma'am.\"\n\nThe President of the United States ground out a long-suffering sigh.

Wall Street needed something to reassure its stockholders just as much as the President needed something to reassure the Rightists that she wasn't just brown-nosing Harrington and his ilk. Pundits, insiders and the press corps - the Three Norns of the Beltway - had already trumpeted the consequent meeting as a reaffirmation of a symbiotic relationship as old as the Civil War.\n\n'So much for trusting precedent,' thought the President grumblingly.\n\n\"I personally wouldn't call labor reform part of precedent-\"\n\n\"What did I say about listening to my thoughts, Ted?\""

Silence reigned until Vice President Agnew chimed in with a suggestion. \"Suppose we let the states fund a portion themselves.\"\n\n\"Then the costs go down. Considerably. Getting them onboard is another problem entirely...\"\n\nLong trailed off. Smith filled in the gaps herself - one gap shaped like the American South, in particular. Still added expenses for their state governments, but with much more leeway on what to spend, how much to spend... and who they should spend on. The federal government would have no choice in the latter.\n\nWith the specter of Wallace looming over their heads, Margaret Chase Smith decided:"

The second's replaced the aforementioned excerpts with detailed plans for improving labor protections for every American worker. The third had a page eight inasmuch as it lacked a page twelve; vague, off-handed references to poverty relief dispersed throughout the text substituted for condensed policy proposals that took up a whole leaf.\n\nWhen Agnew returned, he immediately fed two of the drafts to a paper shredder.

I've read the bill end to end; with how little it actually solves all the paper you've wasted on it's worth only for toiletry!\"\n\n\"Where are the just shares for laborers working eight-to-eights eight days a week?\" he roared, making wide, sweeping gestures of his arms with every crescendo. \"Where are the lifelines between America's cornucopian fields and America's teeming famished? Where are our safeguards against predators with more wealth than the Lord and none of His mercy?\"\n\nBy now the bill had become an uneven layer of office paper blanketing the Great Seal in white, circumscribing an angry, panting Jeremiah. \"This is no proposal Madam President: this is an ultimatum guised as one.

Cigar smoke wafted from an ash tray, just beyond her shaky fingertips, atop a table carved out of a shipwreck. The grandfather clock had just struck an ungodly hour: ten, midnight, quarter to four.\n\nThe President sighed. What a perfect microcosm of the NPP. God willing, an inaccurate one come - she glanced at the clock, its arms fixed at half past two - the early morning.\n\nOne moment stretched into several dozen as neither Smith, nor Harrington, nor Thurmond said a word. Then, lips wavering yet pursed, the Missourian spoke up. \"It's agreeable,\" Harrington admitted. \"Not optimal, not sufficient, not even acceptable. But someone,\" he side-eyed a certain Senator, \"will do their damndest to block the vote himself if we ask for more.\"\n\n\"For once I agree with the Communist,\" replied Thurmond. \"At the least, we've each made fair concessions for the Pact's sake. Repercussions can be handled later; now's time we show the RDC that America had made their best choice in twenty Goddamn years.\"\n\nDisbelief gave way to relief and Margaret's weight against the velvet-lined chair.

Her Chief of Staff did good work in ordering enough for every attendee, some several dozens in all. The cost might haunt her wallet tomorrow morning; then again, nobody said impressed millionaires weren't expensive.\n\nWhat common sense does say is that impressed millionaires are worth their weight in gold. More specifically, their pockets'.\n\n\"Anyone would welcome a gift from the Preisdent ma'am,\" offered Agnew, voice muffled from the handkerchief enveloping half his face. \"Even ones that kill you in twenty years.\"\n\nThe President smiled despite the dig at her habit. Now was time to celebrate small victories, like the compromise she had just brokered with her congenial acquaintances in the Fortune 500. Will Thurmond and friends paint her red so soon after she made peace with the captains of industry bankrolling the Pact's warchests?"

She is a friend and a colleague in the Senate, among the first to represent her state's true interests when the Republicans and Democrats no longer did. That she became the first Madam President in our history serves as an inspiring reminder that anyone, even those of the fairer sex, can lead the Free World if they worked hard and did their best.\n\n(SEN. THURMOND pauses to sip water.)\n\nSEN. THURMOND: Which brings me to my one complaint against her. You've no doubt already heard of the President's addresses as of late, whether from the radio, print, TV, or even word of mouth. They told of the so-called \"welfare for the American people\", and the prosperity it'll bring for everyone. But don't be fooled: the President spoke of handouts in all but name.\n\n(Murmurs erupt from the audience.)\n\nSEN. THURMOND: Our grandpappies always tell us that the man who's taught to fish will live a full life 'til he's old and grey, and that a man who knows only how to take fish from others will take his way to an early grave. We'll have failed the Founders indeed if America turns from a nation of fishers to a nation of fish-takers. That may do for the reds and their misguided allies. But will it do for us? Will it do for hardworking Americans, like you and I? Must it do for our daughters, the new generation of American citizens, and who'll soon fill your shoes twenty years from now and nurture the next?"

Elderly people are an incredibly vulnerable group when it comes to healthcare, plagued by predatory insurance providers and skyrocketing premiums - and it is up to us to fix that problem.\n\nThe new NPP-sponsored bill aims to enroll all citizens aged 65 or above in one common, federally managed insurance program. Backed by the government, this program would offer essentially free healthcare services to those over the cutoff age. Partly, it'd be financiated through a new payroll tax - however, a significant part of its budget would stem directly from the federal treasury revenue. Quite a few small-government proponents already voiced their concerns about the massive increase in federal spending this bill would cause, and their voices are amplified by radical segregationists who despise any sort of government program that does not specifically exclude those of African descent."

 schlafly.4.t:0 "备忘录：进攻策略"
 schlafly.4.desc:0 "[?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong]\n布坎南/科尔森\n\n上周，我同科尔森制定了下述策略。其中包括通过了Simulatrics测试的谈话要点。此外，城市自由派及其建制派支持者用以恐吓主流大众的声明、立场和投票也列入其中。\n\n一般性建议\n\n一、我们应维持美国政治的反建制派传统。NPP政治家以此为生，施拉夫利总统也利用了这一传统，她在72年选举中呼吁普罗大众团结在她身边，共同抵抗精英支持的街头暴民。我们要强调建制派媒体对施拉夫利总统的恶毒攻击，以及他们对普通美国人的鄙夷。\n\n二、我们应逆转“和大企业同床共枕”的形象，以此争取传统上支持民主党的工人阶级。为此，我们应凸显自由派的过激政策。施拉夫利总统的敌人是《纽约时报》和伯克利等自视清高的自由派精英，他们憎恨劳苦大众，是堕落的极端分子，热衷于在刊物上发表同性恋、社会主义和仇男女权主义思想。我们应尽可能地激怒这一群体（见柯立芝高中事件），公众越将他们与共民联盟联系在一起，结果对我们就越好。\n\n三、近期针对行政令的法院决议反而可以令其更具说服力。虽然纽约和加州的禁制令是个严重打击，但我们完全可以说，这是自由派政府和能动法官在替贪婪的造王者阔佬行事。自由主义阴谋集团正在攻击美国的灵魂，施拉夫利总统的改革有理有据，旨在制止思想灌输和同性恋宣传，但他们却想加以阻止。\n\n四、在和法院斗争的过程中，我们应不遗余力地将施拉夫利总统塑造为为普通人而战的“行动派”。总统应在镜头前签署行政令，应为与法院决定抗争的司法部长提供建议，等等。应想办法让施拉夫利总统领导抗议，揭露并将法官中的女权分子赶下台。"
