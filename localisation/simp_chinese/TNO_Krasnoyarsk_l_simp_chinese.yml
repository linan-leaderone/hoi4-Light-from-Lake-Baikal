 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_ANDREEV_DESC: "尼古拉·特罗菲莫维奇·安德烈耶夫于1905年出生。1935年，他被从预备役中征召，重新加入红军，并成为了西伯利亚的一名政委。最开始他还怀抱与德国人作战的希望，但却进入了军官学校。但随着战争局势变得越来越令人绝望，他却在不断学习越来越多的课程——不是为了磨练技能，而是想拖延时间，避免被派到一场他认为注定失败的事业去。苏联崩溃后，他和军官毕业生同学们结成一个小集团，开始在克拉斯诺亚尔斯克地区巩固权力。当中西伯利亚共和国成立时，共和国政府担心这类事先产生的团体会威胁到其民主制度，于是安德烈耶夫的集团被解散，他们被打散发配到共和国领土的各个偏远角落。安德烈耶夫被安排在尼古拉·克雷洛夫的指挥下，但他仍秘密地与他的同道们保持联系。\n\n随着共和国开始失去对权力的控制，开始分崩离析时，安德烈耶夫集团在克拉斯诺亚尔斯克再次集结，并在克雷洛夫将军向西伯利亚黑军发起那注定失败的攻势时发动了兵变。为了让这座城市的人们相信他们不只是改头换面的军政府，安德烈耶夫和他的军官们许诺了将进行全新的全面的改革：自由贸易！私有财产！外国援助！公开选举！自由！民主！\n\n随着先前秩序的崩溃，安德烈耶夫集团认为统一西伯利亚的重任落在了他们的肩上。要实现统一，向东边大海的冲刺必不可少，并随之获得外国的承认，然后再巩固和准备推动解放整个俄罗斯。但是，安德烈耶夫是否真的能够实现这些承诺，那就是另外一回事了。"
 MILITARY_NIKOLAI_ANDREEV_DESC: "§LBorn 1905 in Moscow, Nikolai Trofimovich Andreev worked as a messenger, blacksmith's apprentice and printer before finally joining the Red Army in 1935, becoming an infantry commander in the 93rd Rifle Division and then military commissar of the Taishet district in the Irkutsk region in 1938. Originally eager to go to the front when Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Andreev was instead sent east to take officer courses. Yet as the Soviet Union began to collapse under the German onslaught and the Politburo evacuated east, he instead made every effort to delay being sent to fight and with a clique of fellow officer school graduates solidified power in the city of Krasnoyarsk. Initially treated with suspicion by the Central Siberian Republic, Andreev's clique was broken apart and scattered across various assignments, with Andreev himself placed under the command of Nikolay Krylov. Capable however of seeing the writing on the wall during the Siberian War, Andreev reassembled his clique in their old base of power and mutinied against Krylov, putting an end to the Central Siberian Republic."
 MILITARY_ALEXEY_PESTEREV_DESC: "§LBorn 1910 in Buryatia, Alexey Ivanovich Pesterev worked as a collective farmer and builder, joining the Communist Party in 1939 before being drafted into the Red Army in 1941. Serving as a political commissar in the 209th Infantry Division, Pesterev rose rapidly to become Acting Commander of the 932th Infantry Regiment through both personal merit and the sheer rate of attrition suffered in the face of the German onslaught through the Soviet Union. Evacuating what little remained of his regiment across the Urals under heavy fire, Pesterev was placed under the command of Nikolai Andreev who, impressed by Pesterev's resolve, quickly inducted him into his own clique. Assigned a key role in the mutiny against Nikolay Krylov, Pesterev secured crossings across the Yenisei River, stranding several of Krylov's regiments on the west bank and ensuring their destruction at the hands of the Siberian Black Army.§!"
 MILITARY_NIKOLAI_LYASHCHENKO_DESC: "§LBorn in Irkutsk in 1910, Nikolai Grigoryevich Lyaschenko spent his early life in Kyrgyzstan becoming a groom and blacksmith before joining the local trade union committee and then volunteering for the Red Army in 1929. Serving in the Sino-Soviet conflict with distinction, he was sent to the Central Asian Military School and graduated in 1932, serving as an infantry commander in the 73rd Infantry Division. Awarded the Order of the Red Star for merit in 1936, Lyaschenko served in the Spanish Civil War as a military advisor and returned with the Order of the Red Banner, immediately being sent for further study upon his return. An early member of the graduate clique of Nikolai Andreev during the Soviet collapse, Lyaschenko was sent to Novosibirsk as part of the Central Siberian Republic's effort to break apart the clique, serving with characteristic valor in the Siberian War. It was to be short lived however, returning to Krasnoyarsk following Alexander Pokryshkin's betrayal of the Republic, only to end up betraying the Republic himself.§!"
 MILITARY_ALEKSANDRA_SAMUSENKO_DESC: "§LBorn in 1922 and rumored to have served in the Spanish Civil War in her teens, Aleksandra Grigoryevna Samusenko joined the Red Army in 1935. Originally serving in an infantry platoon, she served first in the Russo-Finnish 'Winter War' before graduating from the tank academy and joining the 1st Guards Tank Army as their only female tanker. Highly decorated for bravery and a recipient of the Order of the Red Star, Samusenko led the battered remnants of the 97th Tank Brigade of the Guard over the Urals following Operation Barbarossa and joined her Brigade to the Central Siberian Republic. Placed under the command of Nikolay Krylov, the destruction of the tank corps of the Grand Army of the Republic in the Siberian War pushed Samusenko into joining Nikolai Andreev in his mutiny against Krylov, the final nail in the Republic's coffin.§!"

 KRS_wild_promises_desc: "自从苏联、中西伯利亚共和国相继灭亡后，人民对于我们随后成立的政府多少是有些不信任的。为了博取支持，安德烈耶夫总统许下了天马行空的诺言，在每一场雷声大雨点小的讲话中，都振振有词地说要提供各种社会政治经济改革。虽然委员长还能镇住他们，但人民很快就会要求兑现承诺。这个国家的实际状态比我们向人民宣传的更加危险，我们脚下的道路狭窄又危险，但假如我们成功，或许真的能将这些诺言兑现吧。"
