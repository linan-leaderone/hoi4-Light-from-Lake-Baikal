 POLITICS_ALBERT_BORMANN_DESC:0 "In a regime as prone to nepotism and corruption as the Reich's, one would naturally expect the brother of one of the top party officials to rise high in his own right regardless of competence. Albert Bormann would disagree. Despite being the brother of the head of the Parteikanzlei and one of the most powerful men in the Reich, Albert's chilly relationship with his elder sibling has ensured his lack of continued mobility into the upper ranks of the government. Still, the industrious former attaché to the Führer is not without his own allies. Naturally, the man he once served as a go-between for the Heer, Adolf Hitler, was always fond of him, and it was really only with the late Führer's patronage that Albert escaped being sent off to rot in one of the farther-flung Reichskommissariats by his estranged brother.\n\nThe Führer's death threatened to upend all that. It would have, that is, had not the victor been the other main protector within the halls of the Reich's power: Hermann Göring, the darling of the militarists. It was this militarism that drew the official to the Reichsmarshall, along with the man's own considerable charm, something that Martin never really had. Now, Göring has found in the brother of one of his greatest foes a competent administrator, willing to carry out his orders without hesitation or mercy."

 GENERAL_JOHANNES_STEINHOFF_DESC:0 "§LAmong the heroes of the Luftwaffe, there is one pilot who stands head and shoulders above almost all others: Johannes Steinhoff. One of the most experienced aces of all time, Steinhoff was one of the very few pilots on either side of the Second World War to survive from the war's start to its end, flying combat missions throughout. Even after suffering horrific burns following a disastrous accident while test piloting the ME262 jet prototype, Steinhoff was back in the skies as soon as the doctors cleared him. Not wanting to lose such a valuable asset, Hermann Göring assigned Steinhoff to the Luftwaffe's pilot academy, where he served as head instructor for several years. Steinhoff would fly again during the West Russian War, and when that conflict too had passed he had hoped to live out the rest of his days peacefully as a teacher. It was not to be however, as the Bürgerkrieg enveloped Germany, the ace was faced with a hard choice. Eventually, he chose to follow Hermann Göring, the appointed successor to the late Führer. This time, the Reichsmarshall had more than just an instructor's billet in mind for Steinhoff, and shortly after Göring's victory the old veteran found himself as the new Oberbefehlshaber der Luftwaffe.§!"
 GER_Otto_Ernst_Remer_army_chief:0 "§YIf Schörner is the butcher, Otto Ernst Remer is his bloody knife. As a young officer coming of age just before the rise of the Nazis, Remer devoted himself body and soul to the National Socialist cause. Remer served with distinction in the campaigns against Poland, the Balkans, and during Operation Barbarossa, eventually rising to a battalion command in the Grossdeutschland Division. Remer's crowning glory came when he was personally awarded Oak leaves to his Knight's Cross by no less than the Führer, Adolf Hitler, himself. Remer's unit served in the thickest fighting of the war, from the deep heart of Russia where the Union was finally broken to the hills of North England where war finally came to its close.\n\nIn the long years since then, Remer has steadily grown in his influence within the Wehrmacht, rapidly rising to become Field Marshal Ferdinand Schörner's right hand man, and as a consequence, the second most powerful man in the militarist faction of the officer corps. While Remer does have a strong degree of respect for his fellow warmonger and direct superior, his loyalty truly lies only with whoever he believes furthers the cause of the ultimate global victory of National Socialism, and whomever he thinks can best support that goal with action.§!"

 GER_Rudolf_Diels_sec_desc:0 "§YChef der Geheime Staatspolizei\nNational Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LBefore there was Hangman Heydrich, before there was Gestapo Müller, there was Rudolf Diels. Diels is another of the long-time Göring cronies who have seen their fortunes rise dramatically thanks to their patron's ascent to Führership. Diels and Göring first met in 1933 when the latter was given the position as Minister-President of Prussia where Diels served as the head of the Preußische Geheimpolizei, the state's secret police. Thanks to his work, Diels had an encyclopedic knowledge of prominent political figures, including members of the Nazi party, and some of their dirtiest secrets. Seeing the potential benefit of having Diels' knowledge at his beck and call, Göring established what would soon become the Gestapo and placed Diels in charge of it. Diels tenure as Gestapo director would only last a year however as Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich would work to undercut him within the government. Their maneuvering paid off and in 1934 Diels's tenure came to an end with Reinhard Heydrich succeeding him as the head of the Gestapo.\n\nDiels has kept largely to himself for the past two decades, although his connection to the Reichsmarschall has only deepened - he is even married to Ilse Göring, cousin of the Führer. Now that the accursed Heydrich is gone however, Diels can regain control of the organization that was always rightfully his and a new era of the Gestapo's dominance within the Reich is about to commence.§!"
