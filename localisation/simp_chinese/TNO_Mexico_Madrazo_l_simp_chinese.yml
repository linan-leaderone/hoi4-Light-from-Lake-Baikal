 MEX_rural_depression_madrazo_1_desc:0 "在“土地与自由”的革命口号推动下，名为“埃西多”的集体农庄制度应运而生。该制度下，土地为联邦所有，并分配到集体耕作的农民手中。这一制度的初衷是要给予墨西哥农民前所未有的自主权利，马德拉索总统已着手采取措施使其现代化，但任重而道远。"

 MEX_rural_depression_madrazo_2_desc:0 "在“土地与自由”的革命口号推动下，名为“埃西多”的集体农庄制度应运而生。该制度下，土地为联邦所有，并分配到集体耕作的农民手中。这一制度的初衷是要给予墨西哥农民前所未有的自主权利，在马德拉索的远见卓识下，许多农庄都摆脱了外国资本的盘剥，成功实现了现代化。"
 MEX_the_door_opens:0 "敞开大门…"
 MEX_the_door_opens_desc:0 "多年以来，每当马德拉索遭遇丑闻时，反对派们都希望这能一举扳倒他；这走过头的一步，这大概、或许能让卡洛斯·A·马德拉索在政治上一路狂飙的旅程结束的一刻，就如他那在革命制度党的任期中灼热而又火爆。\n\n然而随着他亲自步入国家宫，人们呼喊着改变、改革、改善他们的人生的时候，东南气旋和他志同道合的内阁成员们又再一次地证明反对派们错的彻底。但是，马德拉索高举的革命之火此刻却无比的微弱：政治冷感统治了整个国家，名为权力的双刃剑在此刻也无比贴近自己的胸膛。\n\n这会成为他的杰作，抑或是为他敲响的丧钟？"
 MEX_doctors_in_our_streets:0 "医生上街"
 MEX_doctors_in_our_streets_desc:0 "毫无疑问，我们手头从上届政府那里继承来的一个大麻烦就是愈演愈烈的医生罢工。最初只有几百名独立于革命制度党体制的中产阶级医生参加的运动，如今已经发展为抗议整个医疗卫生产业中的糟糕条件和低薪的全国性运动；看来，他们是希望能够“揭露我们的真面目”。\n\n不过，在这冲突中也蕴含着机遇。虽然许多人希望我们派警察解决问题，但我们会和罢工者坐在一起，倾听他们的诉求；毕竟，如果镇压真像党内其他成员认为的那样有效，那当上总统的人就该是他们了。"
 MEX_back_to_work:0 "回去工作！"
 MEX_back_to_work_desc:0 "在我们向医生做出短期让步的同时，政府内的一些人士提出可以通过和这些独立的社会组织合作来实现长期的妥协，也就是将它们纳入革命制度党的体制中。尽管在理想的情况下，我们可以让他们理解我们的理念和想法，但现在并不是能花时间妥协和谈判的时候。\n\n你要怎么向群众解释，他们的爷爷是因为政客和官僚们在冗长的谈判中阻挠了专业人士的果断行动，结果硬生生地拖后了重启医疗系统的时间？\n\n当下，最重要的不是他们是否同意我们的条件，而是他们必须立刻回去工作。"
 MEX_bring_them_in:0 "听取诉求"
 MEX_bring_them_in_desc:0 "在我们向医生做出短期让步的同时，政府内的一些人士提出可以通过和这些独立的社会组织合作来实现长期的妥协，也就是将它们纳入革命制度党的体制中。毫无疑问，这一进程将是艰难且漫长的，那些认为我们是在向独立于革命制度党的工会和组织妥协的人也会对此感到不满。然而，罗马不是一天建成的，墨西哥城也不是。\n\n局面会升级到今天的地步本身就意味着旧的党的失败。它太过安于现状，盲目地相信自己拥有稳固的基本盘，这种自满让他们失去了对国家的控制。就像药一样，良药苦口，但国家的健康和我们得到的支持都将更加稳固。"
 MEX_but_watch_out_for_the_rats:0 "……但要当心硕鼠"
 MEX_but_watch_out_for_the_rats_desc:0 "政治家没有敌人，说明他不代表任何人的利益。在对抗个人私利与自满情绪的战场上，我们便是改革革命制度党和墨西哥、使其实现革命真谛的旗帜。而这面旗帜正处在投机分子的重重包围之中，他们寻找着我们防御的裂隙和革命制度党内的反动分子，意图让党倒退回自满和腐败的旧时代。\n\n我们对突发危机的妥善应对也许可以一时打乱他们的阵脚，但在党内秘密反对分子的支持下，他们很快就会带着新的密谋卷土重来。我们不能阻止他们未来的进攻，但可以找出谁会是我们未来前进道路上的绊脚石。"
 MEX_for_the_eternal_revolution:0 "为了永恒的革命"
 MEX_for_the_eternal_revolution_desc:0 "突发的危机尘埃落定，内阁办公室里也恢复了过去的平静。我们的反对者已经放弃了他们的计划，人们也回到了他们平凡的日常生活中。希望明天，我们肩上的担子会轻一些。\n\n在这段平静的时间里，我们的计划终于拟定完毕——那就是让当下已经变得如此冰凉和反复无常的革命之火重燃，让三十年前那熊熊燃烧、无可阻挡的冲天烈火再次点燃，还有谁能比“塔瓦斯科气旋”马德拉索更能向全国展示并实现它？这份演讲绝不能只是空口承诺，不只是挣脱出这片耗干我们潜能的停滞泥潭的承诺，更是对那些妄图打倒我们的势力的宣战书。\n\n毕竟，这只是暴风雨前的宁静。"
 MEX_menas_failures:0 "梅纳的错误"
 MEX_menas_failures_desc:0 "著名的安东尼奥·奥尔蒂斯·梅纳被党内的许多人视作墨西哥奇迹的建筑师。尽管这一说法不无道理，但同样不可否认的是，他的大规模工业化计划不仅毁掉了我们的革命，还破坏了党的农业背景、糟蹋了整个国家。虽然留下活该被解雇的他会比直接把他开除麻烦得多，但我们依然会和梅纳一起合作来让他弥补自己犯下的错误。"
 MEX_necessary_increase:0 "必要的增税"
 MEX_necessary_increase_desc:0 "实施社会福利和建设公共基础设施必定会导致支出上涨。为了保持预算平衡，我们必须增加政府收入。好在墨西哥的税率一贯很低，这为我们提供了充足的资金来源：提高税率、增加关税与实施累进都是可选的办法。\n\n但增税从来都不简单，受此影响的群体与个人肯定不会对此感到满意。上到大企业，下到普通农民都将对此表示反对，因为此举会影响他们的收入，打击他们的信心。可以预想到，由此产生的社会不满可能会在短期内滋生一些事端。但长期来看，我们的计划将为国家带来长治久安。"
 MEX_seven_wonders_of_mexico:0 "墨西哥七大奇迹"
 MEX_seven_wonders_of_mexico_desc:0 "新税收正源源不断地流入，马德拉索觉得现在是用上这笔钱的好时候了，是时候设立几个比之前他想象中更为宏大的项目了。所有的这些项目都旨在提高那些真正建立了墨西哥的人们，那些勤劳的工人们。很久以前，玛雅人和阿兹特克人创造了他们的奇迹，而这些奇迹至今仍屹立不倒，现在是时候创造属于我们的不朽之作了。"
 MEX_the_plan_of_65:0 "65计划"
 MEX_the_plan_of_65_desc:0 "马德拉索总统提出了一个引领国家的新方案，而非狭隘地关注经济增长；正是他最初让他得以登上联邦政坛的塔瓦斯科复兴计划，而现在他已经准备好将这一计划扩展到全国。从杂货铺、公路再到资源开采，公共生活的方方面面都将在为墨西哥带来全新气息的国家发展模式下得到长足发展。\n\n考虑到这一计划的高昂开支，奥尔蒂斯·梅纳当然表示反对。我们要么缩减计划规模，剔除一些好高骛远的部分，要么进一步扩大资源开采力度，并将那些在原案中因为考虑到环境破坏问题而被剔除的区域也包括在内。马德拉索总统当然不会因此停下脚步，但他应该怎样取舍？"
 MEX_useful_reshuffle:0 "有效的裁撤"
 MEX_useful_reshuffle_desc:0 "每个政府中都存在投入大量资源却收益寥寥的低效问题，但这不该存在于墨西哥。我们在大规模的体制改革中裁撤掉那些不必要的冗余岗位能为其他工作省出更多资源。而假如是保守派的人接手了这些空缺岗位的工作，那可真是个幸运的巧合。"
 MEX_wrath_of_the_economist:0 "经济学家的怒火"
 MEX_wrath_of_the_economist_desc:0 "目前，政府内部对墨西哥经济的看法存在两套截然不同的观点，一个是马德拉索总统的理想主义，一个是梅纳的实用主义。然而，马德拉索和梅纳的公开决裂将是一场灾难，它会彻底毁掉我们的未来赖以立足的墨西哥奇迹。\n\n为了消弭双方的紧张关系，马德拉索总统将和梅纳会见以友好地讨论一系列事务。"
 MEX_struggles_on_the_land:0 "土地改革"
 MEX_struggles_on_the_land_desc:0 "多年以来，墨西哥农民已经对政府丧失了信任，他们中的许多人已经忘记了我们在革命中许下的诺言，也不再将我们视作土改英雄的后继者。他们的负担一天天地加重，而马德拉索总统要实现迟到的变革——不仅要许下宏愿，更要重铸党的精神与灵魂。\n\n是时候迈出第一步，从集体土地开始我们的计划了。"
 MEX_ejido_mechanization:0 "集体土地机械化"
 MEX_ejido_mechanization_desc:0 "集体土地制度的建立是农民在革命中的最大胜利。对马德拉索而言，让这一系统走向现代化也是自然而然的。当下，集体土地深受低效、老旧的农业机械困扰，而政府却对农业系统的运作漠不关心。《集体土地机械化法案》将为全国的集体土地提供现代化生产工具和公共设施，如供电、拖拉机和肥料等。这一举措将极大增加辛苦谋生的农民们的产出，并给生活条件不佳的乡村民众带来更高的收入。"
 MEX_ejido_education:0 "兴办农村教育"
 MEX_ejido_education_desc:0 "为集体土地提供全新的设备和种子已经成为了农业改革的重要一步。但即便如此，农民们缺乏教学和技术的问题使得他们难以从这一福利政策中充分获益。提供现代化技术却不教会农民如何使用它们，只会让整个计划竹篮打水一场空。\n\n一位农民可能了解他的土地，但农业专家懂得土地要想丰收就必不可少的每一个要素。资深的农业专家们将会走遍全国，在集体土地中教授农民们农业科学与生态学的知识以及操作现代农业设备的方法。从落后的耕作方式转变到资深的农业专家，农业部门将走向现代化。"
 MEX_ejido_diversification:0 "农产品多元化"
 MEX_ejido_diversification_desc:0 "玉米、谷物和豆类长期以来都是墨西哥的传统主食和主粮作物。尽管它们的出口十分稳定，但在日趋多样化的全球市场上，新的市场需求推升了其他作物的价格，同时压低了这三种传统作物的价格。我们的农民难以继续靠这三种传统作物谋生了。为了促进农业的多样化，我们要帮助农民接受新的作物，例如富有营养的苹果和冬季蔬菜，这些种子应当分发给可以从这些新作物中获利的贫困农民。"
 MEX_the_rival_outfit:0 "竞争对手"
 MEX_the_rival_outfit_desc:0 "尽管农业现代化确实是一项重大的进步，我们绝不能忘了毒害着农村的真正敌人——那就是农业大资本。集体土地制度的创制是一项关键的改革，它改善了无数农民的生活；然而，当跨国资本涌入这个国家时，集体土地改革却被它们视若无物。大企业牢不可破的垄断压低了工资、掠夺了财富、带来了不人道的恶劣工作条件，从而恶化了农民群体的生活质量。\n\n宪法第二十七条授予我们对墨西哥土地和水资源的管理权，也包括私有财产。援引这一条款，我们有权消灭外资垄断。通过加税和严格限制农业大资本，集体土地体制在我国农业中的影响将进一步扩大。"
 MEX_smash_the_commercial_vultures:0 "射落资本秃鹫"
 MEX_smash_the_commercial_vultures_desc:0 "宪法第二十七条表明我们党拥有管理我国领土和资源的权力，因而，我们必须无条件地巩固这一权力。美日两国的农业大资本集团都在渗透和腐化墨西哥，如同秃鹫一般掠夺、毒害着我们的国家，它们出于牟利目的带来的非人道低工资和恶劣的工作环境加剧了贫富分化。对这些大资本进行没收和拆分将有助于加强国家对经济的控制，土地和自然资源的所有权也将被重新分配给集体土地。通过消灭这些资本秃鹫，我国农业的腐败将被剐除，其人道性将得以恢复。"
 MEX_smash_the_commercial_vultures_tt:0 "选择该国策将改变§Y……他们怎么想？§!的效果，使之对§K墨西哥§!更有利。"
 MEX_the_great_southern_plan:0 "伟大南部计划"
 MEX_the_great_southern_plan_desc:0 "过去，作为塔瓦斯科州的州长，马德拉索使那个贫穷且被忽视的州一转成为繁荣且现代化的地区。他缔造这一成就有三大要诀：福利项目、渐进改革、社会团结。面对激进极左分子和贪婪资本集团的反对浪潮，实用主义和社会主义的力量岿然不动。\n\n回顾过去的成就，毋庸置疑，渐进的改良远胜于激进的变革。尽管宪法第二十七条威力强大，我们还是不能冒着破坏我国经济稳定的风险。相反，我们应当缓慢地国有化我们的自然资源和集体化特定的生产设施，如酿酒厂、面包房和罐头厂。"
 MEX_and_what_do_they_think:0 "……他们怎么想？"
 MEX_and_what_do_they_think_desc:0 "我们站在两个超级大国间的十字路口，一个鼓吹共荣“自由”，一个则是自由主义霸权国家。墨西哥在黑暗中独行，她的革命不被他人在意；但正是这革命，令墨西哥之火长明不息。面对帝国主义，我们为自由而战；面对公司剥削，社会福利造福人民；面对外国资产阶级，墨西哥无产阶级奋起反击。\n\n正因如此，我们必须要为它们的激烈反应和潜在报复做好准备，因为即使革命不断前进，我们的主权也无时无刻不在受到它们的威胁。要准确估计他们的反应是几乎不可能的，但准备总是必要的。为了迎接极端的冲击，我们当然可以使用我们的国家准备金。"
 MEX_rusted_grip_of_poverty:0 "生锈的贫穷枷锁"
 MEX_rusted_grip_of_poverty_desc:0 "从暴君波菲里奥·迪亚斯之流统治的时代起，墨西哥的广大农民就是社会不公的受害者，他们在贫穷的泥潭里苦苦挣扎时，富人却大肆囤积着不义之财。多亏了革命制度党的革命，我们已经实现了长足的社会进步，但依然有大量底层民众在贫穷和不安全中挣扎谋生。是时候为他们做些什么了！\n\n马德拉索总统已经摆明了他的立场：他任期的最终目标就是一劳永逸地消灭社会不公！贫困的枷锁如同钢铁一般坚硬，但它已然开始生锈，总有办法能把它砸得粉碎！"
 MEX_after_three_its_too_late:0 "从三岁前抓起"
 MEX_after_three_its_too_late_desc:0 "建设一个更现代、更平等社会的关键是对年轻一代的教育，正如著名CEO兼慈善家井深大所言，儿童打小就有难以置信的学习能力。如果要开发出他们的全部潜能，等到幼儿园就已经太晚了！因此，总统已经奠定了同时在家庭和学校中教育下一代的基础，有了它，我们就能确保一个更加繁荣的未来。"
 MEX_for_every_head_a_roof:0 "居者有其屋"
 MEX_for_every_head_a_roof_desc:0 "随着工业化进程稳步推进，墨西哥的城市也蓬勃发展，但这一切并非没有代价。工人和他们的家人离开农村，住进了大城市里，但他们的住房选择却受到限制，有时连基本需求都无法满足，他们的潜能和才华也因此受到限制。当政府将工作重心放在农村人口身上时，我们也不能放任城市家庭生活在这般恶劣的环境。"
 MEX_enlarge_on_mateos:0 "胜于马特奥斯"
 MEX_enlarge_on_mateos_desc:0 "在马特奥斯总统的任期里，他为我们的国家和革命指明了正确的道路，其中最为重要的莫过于1957年的卡德纳斯主义宣言，但这还不够！如果革命制度党要把革命进行到底，就得干的更多！马德拉索总统已经表明了他的立场：卡德纳斯主义宣言中的每一个项目都将得到扩展！政府将借助这些项目，更好地为墨西哥人民服务，并把国家带向更光明的未来。"
 MEX_to_heal_a_nation:0 "治愈国家"
 MEX_to_heal_a_nation_desc:0 "年复一年，疾病在乡村肆虐，带走了无数人的生命。由于暴露了我国医疗系统脆弱性的医生罢工，这场健康安全危机并没有什么改观。然而，设法解决我国医疗系统的问题可以极大提高我们在国内外的声誉，提振国民的士气，让我们更受欢迎，并且让整个国家更健康。"
 MEX_under_the_hood:0 "庙堂之中"
 MEX_under_the_hood_desc:0 "墨西哥人民心中有一点是毋庸置疑的，那就是对变革的渴望。自从1911年波菲里奥·迪亚斯政权垮台，无数革命者来了又走，他们有些被尊为英雄，有些被斥为罪人。在多年的撕裂对抗之后，人民终于选择了正确的道路，将权力赋予了我们。\n\n但在人民群众眼里，我们已经辜负了人民的期望。鉴于之后的历届政府在农业、社会政策和经济上的失败，这种观点是正确的：革命制度党的框架已然腐烂，沦为了墨西哥最为腐败、贪婪和卑鄙之人的保护伞。我们这个寡头政党已然沦为了地方豪强的走狗，对人民实施着备受唾弃的暴政。我们放任了反动派和布尔什维主义者操纵着人民填补我们留下的权力真空。我们必须找回本心，赓续曾经的革命精神，并让革命制度党永远团结在一起。"
 MEX_whip_corruption:0 "扫除腐败"
 MEX_whip_corruption_desc:0 "讽刺的是，很多时候最伟大的战士曾经是他们所对抗之物的完美典范。我们自己的总统便曾是拜占庭式官僚体制的受害者，他被卷入了一场移民卡项目诈骗并遭到短期监禁。\n\n腐败是最大的伪善，它以公肥私，动用种种手段打击敢于揭露它的人来自保。卡洛斯·马德拉索和他的盟友深知这一点，并且明白反腐措施不能只对准基层税务员之类的小苍蝇，更要打击那些在众议院与革命制度党内部身居高位的大老虎。"
 MEX_let_sleeping_bribes_lie:0 "顺其自然"
 MEX_let_sleeping_bribes_lie_desc:0 "卡洛斯·马德拉索深知，地方行政的繁琐冗杂不能被简单概括为“腐败”或“滥用权力”所致。很多时候，由于当地条件过于糟糕，农村地区的行政机关经常要违规挪用资金才能保证政府的基本功能。我们也不能忽略，有时被认为是“腐败”的行为只不过是给有需要的人们稍稍法外开恩了一下。我们的总统就发现过这些灰色地带是如何给人们的生计造成潜在危害的——如此之多的违法犯罪竟然只是为了给几个移民找到工作！\n\n革命制度党是一台上满润滑油的机器，难道这代表它的许多齿轮就该被撕裂，然后被视作次品抛弃吗？难道这代表这台机器必须合乎外行和永远在抱怨的记者之流捏造的技术标准吗？有些可以凑合的事还是不要变比较好。"
 MEX_the_great_winnowing:0 "党内大筛查"
 MEX_the_great_winnowing_desc:0 "可悲的事实是，当一个组织在勤恳、干练的政治家领导下为国家的未来殚精竭虑时，投机者、地主和其他剥削者则如同寄生虫一般混入了党内。他们践踏了人民的信任，巧取豪夺，令真正诚实的改革者们荣誉蒙尘。\n\n从土耳其到中国，甚至日本那样繁荣的超级大国，这种现象比比皆是，但我国的情况尤为恶劣。土地出售名单上是清一色的党员，工厂的所有者和管理者也是党员。在我们的统治下，这种组织关系使得他们事实上享有强大的豁免权，即使作恶多端也不会被追究法律责任。是时候结束这种情况了。虽然我们党在国家治理中的核心地位不能动摇，但它今后也不再会被躲藏在幕后的自负精英们把持。"
 MEX_one_small_step:0 "一小步"
 MEX_one_small_step_desc:0 "自革命制度党崛起以来，墨西哥的政治活动就遭到了极大的限制。很多情况下，这对人民来说是好事，因为地主几乎无法掀起全国范围的反动争论，有政治诉求的暴力游击队也难以影响到政府行政。我们党对政府的控制也使我们能通过如墨西哥工人联合会之类的组织控制工会活动。\n\n墨西哥工人联合会是革命制度党和墨西哥劳动者的耻辱。在菲德尔·贝拉斯克斯，这个典型的卑鄙、自私且工于算计的小人的领导下，这个曾经的草根工会联盟已经事实上堕落成了墨西哥工业复合体的鹰犬，比起工人更多地为雇主的利益服务。如果要在墨西哥进行真正的改革，我们就必须先旁敲侧击地削弱这一庞大、腐败的组织。我们可能没法直接把贝拉斯克斯拉下马，但我们至少能让墨西哥工人联合会今后的运作更有价值。"
 MEX_the_fires_of_youth:0 "青年之火"
 MEX_the_fires_of_youth_desc:0 "马德拉索知道学生们的政治潜力。从墨西哥青年联合会的领导人到塔瓦斯科的州长，马德拉索汲取了青年的力量与热情，化身为党对抗反动恐怖主义和腐败的先锋。\n\n马德拉索知道，当代的革命制度党并不是一个适合年轻人发展的地方。党被无能的老人领导着，富有远见的年轻人最多却只能被安排到地方上去。马德拉索找到了这些富有远见的人，而且他知道还有更多这样的人有待发掘。"

 MEX_hornets_in_the_engine_chamber:0 "燃烧室的大黄蜂"
 MEX_hornets_in_the_engine_chamber_desc:0 "反动的力量总是尝试阻挠着进步的正道。正如我们所料，保守派和技官派与革命曾经面对过的其他反动派没有什么根本差别。然而，他们对我们的进步造成的损害已经远超任何人的想象，他们的顽固也令我们的盟友难以继续前进。\n\n显然，如果我们要实现我们的目标，实现马德拉索总统对墨西哥的伟大愿景，我们将不得不独自开始斗争。变革已至，反对者们不想体面地让道，我们就要帮他们体面。"

They are misled! What of the Revolution? What about this country? What about its people?

Stopping at a corner, Camila saw her favourite haunt - the Chestnut Café - only this time it was boarded up and dilapidated, the space where the front door used to be replaced with yellow police tape. In front of the condemned building, a balding man whom Camila did not recognise helmed a makeshift podium. It was decorated with PRI flags and slogans, guarded by a sea of redshirted thugs. He gesticulated with pomp and fervour, clasping and tightening his fists; the microphone amplified his booming voice.\n\n“Young people of the nation, turn away from the forces of social dissolution! Serve your nation, serve your countrymen!”\n\nOnly upon hearing this did Camila pay a closer look at the colour guard, particularly their faces, and at one in particular - a girl of similar age, her hair in pigtails, spotted with freckles, but bearing an incensed, threatening gaze that seemed to invite the enemies of the revolution to appear at once, so she and the vanguard could strike them dead.\n\nCamila felt her heart sink.

But he was proud to say there wasn't a farmer in the state without access to a tractor.\n\nThe machines rolled out of Jujutla into the fertile lowlands between the rugged, densely forested hills that surrounded the town. Eventually, they reached their destination: The intersection of the highway and an unpaved road that stretched away into the green fields.\n\nFarmers in dusty chambray and denim clogged the intersection. When they caught sight of the convoy, they cheered, and waved. A few people chanted Héctor's name. He pulled off to the side of the highway, and killed the engine. A farmer struck up an idle conversation until Elena arrived in their aging sedan. Héctor brushed the dust off his coat and got into the car.\n\n\"You've done good for us this time,\" Elena said, flashing a rare smile as they drove back to the town.

Pears, guavas, figs, limes, yams, and so on. Mexico's staples were notably absent.\n\nYams were a particular favorite among the community. Their use in relieving joint pain and the fact that they could use the vegetables to paralyze fish and catch them by hand was enticing. Itzel, a young Nahua woman spoke up, and mentioned that she had heard that the price of yams had skyrocketed. Some factories in the cities were buying them up and turning them into soap. A vote was held. Yams it is.\n\nTwo weeks later, a battered truck rolled to a stop outside the small office.

But they were not staying in Mexico. The vegetables were being sold to American pharmaceutical companies.\n\nAcross the border, the yams were bathed in acid to extract a chemical called diosgenin.

The Cannery was known to squeeze the ejido for every centavo it could, offering criminally low prices for the corn the campesinos grew. The Cannery would package the corn and send it off to upmarket grocery stores in Japan, while the farmers would walk away with scarcely enough to make their efforts worth it. And the campesinos would curse the fact the Cannery was the only one in their area, holding the village under a monopoly.\n\nIt was not the ejido village militant they expected to bring the good news. For too long he had promised the PRI would make things better, so much so everyone had stopped listening to him. But today he screamed with enough vigor and enthusiasm that everyone had to think he really did believe in the news he was spreading. And the teacher confirmed the words on the paper - the Cannery was going to be nationalized by the government! The paperwork was signed by Madrazo himself. And Mexico City was promising to buy the corn at a price floor better than the market!\n\nThe Priest's mind went to writing a sermon giving thanks to God for this act. Many housewives and children thought of the clothes, toys, and furnishings they could buy. A few more ambitious campesinos thought about the top of the line fertilizers and tools they could purchase to get even more money. But for many, they thought of one thing only. This was their ancestors throwing off the Spanish Hacienda. This was the oil being expropriated from the Americans and British. This was the rich Germans fleeing the coffee farms. Now, the arc of the Revolution had come for them.\n\nWhen the crowd arrived at the Cannery, they found the manager had already turned tail and ran. The workers there were not sorry to see him go - in fact the rumors of profit sharing had made them more than open to this new arrangement. So much so they didn't mind that the Campesinos stormed the front office, smashed the Japanese sign on the roof, and hung the Mexican Flag while singing \"¡Viva México, Viva América!\" In fact, the main disagreement with the Ejido the Cannery had was what patriotic name to give it."

She continued to mumble to herself under her breath. \"Such a dangerous part of town, too. You should be out here, but you are too busy doing god knows what.\" All around her, the hustle and bustle of the city streets she called home got just a little bit louder as the kids finally got let out of the former brothel-turned-public preschool.\n\nSifting through the crowd of girls looking for Rosita's new teacher proved to be a challenge, though she spun around after feeling a small hand tug her shirt. \"Camila!\"\n\n\"Come here, you. Let's get you home to your father.\"\n\nAs the two walked home, hands held tightly, Camila's cautious scanning of the streets was interrupted by a blurb from below.\n\n\"Library.\"\n\n\"Huh? What was that, little one?\"\n\n\"We learned about the library. They took us there.\"\n\nCamila stopped. \"How wonderful, Rosita. It is a great place, right?\" Rosita nodded, and Camila's anger at her brother dissipated into thin air at her niece's excitement. What she would have given for an education that young, she thought."

Better she spend time with me than getting up to no good, Camila thought. A three year old needs someone to play with.\n\n\"Camila, look.\" Her small hand pointed towards the loud noises coming from the construction development across the street. \"Houses.\"\n\n\"Isn't that something.\" Camila stopped to look at the new complex, complete with multiple floors, balconies, and what seemed like multi-room condos, at least from what she could gather through the scaffolding.

In the foreground is a wooden podium with the coat of arms of the Free and Sovereign State of Jalisco. Behind them are the Mexican and Jalascan flags, and a banner with the words \"LIVE HEALTHY - LIVE BETTER.\" In front of them are an audience of white coated medical staff applauding as they smile for the camera.\nThe Event: A public unveiling of new plans for the Hospital. With the help of the federal government and the state's secretariat of health, Sayula Municipal Hospital has been given a new funding grant, substantially larger than the old ones. The money has been earmarked for building improvements like new plumbing and a state of the art HVAC system to improve patient comfort and reduce particles in the operating and recovery rooms. Also included in these renovations are funds specifically for a new examination wing with new photographic and X-ray equipment to aid in diagnosis.\nThe Context: Sayula is the center of a series of farming communities centered around the lake that also shares the same name. Its hospital is the biggest medical facility in the local area, and it has not been getting the attention it deserves from the government. With this correction, the hospital can treat and diagnose residents with a level of care much closer to the one found in the city of Guadalajara to the north. Continued investment will ensure Sayula, and Jalisco, and all of Mexico, will have the health facilities they need to fight Mexico's campaign against poverty and deprivation.\nThe Truth: The hospital director is grateful for the funding, and the money will go towards the renovations. But the larger issue is being ignored - in fact, covered up. The white dressed members of the audience are not medical staff in any sense of the term. They are members of the local high school given the coats by the PRI in order to look impressive. In fact the real interns of the hospital have broken for the AMMRI and are nowhere near Sayula. At this moment they are marching outside of the Governor's residence in Guadalajara with compatriots from all over the state, demanding he meet with them."

He had smelt metal, rust, perhaps - or blood?\n\nA voice ricocheted off the walls, wherever they were in the darkness. \"Rojo Gómez has already denounced you, but you remain loyal?\"\n\nMadrazo felt a tightness in his chest. The chamber seemed to close in on his haggard, emaciated body. \"I am innocent,\" nearly choking, \"I did nothing with the papers...\"\n\nHe could hear the rumbling of a baton colliding with metal. The familiar droll sound spurned hatred in his heart. \"...and you are illegally detaining me, on the basis of political disagreement...!\"\n\nThey were the same words Madrazo had repeated when they had asked, and sometimes when they hadn't, just when he felt like he had to speak, to say something, not to lose his mind, to go mad -\n\nMadness!

But one wrong word from Rámon and his career-his life-was over.\n\nHéctor yanked open another drawer. There! He snatched the folder out of the drawer and slapped it down on his desk. The pages inside were stained with guilt. Any lead that an investigator would want to follow was here, stamped in black ink on the ivory paper.\n\nHéctor's breaths grew shorter and shallower. He had to do something. He flipped through the report, removing the offending pages and tucking them into his leather briefcase. Maybe he could alter them? Hide the leads? He was a miracle worker with liquid paper. If that failed, he could burn them.\n\nHéctor buried his head in his hands then let it fall onto his desk with a thud. He had bribed Rámon. Right there with the pesos in the envelope. Would he talk? What if they offered him a plea deal?

It rolled along the desk, hitting the last document he had signed; the expulsion order for Vicente Alcaide, removing him from the ranks of the CNC.\n\nThe trouble was that it was a small world. Most of these expulsion orders Héctor had spent the last hour signing off were his friends, neighbours. He wondered how he would be able to look Señor Alcaide in the eye the next time he saw him - would he hide, explain himself? Such a domineering, tenacious man, left grovelling at the feet of acquaintances for forgiveness. They were not his orders, yes, but would they believe that a man of his stature had no pull anymore?\n\nRámon Delgado's retirement had only made things worse. Men of his generation, good, honest, hardy party members, were dying out. There was no wheat to separate from the chaff with the new crop - leftists, radicals, Lombardists. They knew nothing of the world.\n\nBut they would certainly know of Héctor's repression of the Partido Popular, the fertiliser boycott that was still the source of gossip after all these years.\n\nHow much time did he have left before they kicked the chair out underneath him?"

Héctor lit his boss' cigarette for him. \"A gentleman was looking for you at the office. He didn't leave a name.\"\n\n\"Yes, a state investigator,\" Delgado furrowed his brows. Héctor had already guessed this but didn't want to give too much away. Why should he be afraid, being such an upstanding official? \"They're looking into the crop diversification scheme, there were some irregularities. I got a slap on the wrist.\"\n\nHéctor felt a cool relief soothe him. He had to stop himself from smiling. The bastards hadn't any idea about the tractor bribes.\n\n\"I'm going to retire, Héctor. It's all been too much for me, this stress, this worry. I've had enough.\"\n\nThat relief blackened to gall. \"Surely you need to think this over, señor?\" Delgado got up with a murmured sigh, flicked his cigarette and put on his hat."

The Green Lady, as Héctor came to know it after so many meetings spent staring at it in contempt and seeing dozens of stupid copies of it in print, should have been thrown out long ago. But the office had been virtually left abandoned ever since Delgado's retirement. There had been no official replacement, yet, which gave Héctor considerable worry - was his career on the ropes too?\n\nHéctor spun the chamber. He had driven out earlier that morning to do the rounds among the ejidos only to largely be ignored. The new crop as he liked to call them - the militant party youth who looked up to President Madrazo - had thrown themselves into voluntarism, spurring a new back-to-the-land movement. Not that he disapproved of the good work they were doing, but it was his good work. His duty. What did they know about anything?\n\nClearly something. They were doing such a good job of it that some of the peasants began to treat Héctor with a certain aloofness, as if he hadn't spent his whole life among them.\n\nHe used to be someone.\n\nA wheeler-dealer? Perhaps, but a pillar of the community, well-respected, someone who could provide for others.\n\nA good person? By all accounts.\n\nBut now he could swear he was sprouting grey hairs.

Fitting, really, as the muse of Madrazo's ode was the very head of the university, who sat discreetly off-stage in the wings.\n\n\"There is much more to be said than what I can deliver in words alone. You, the students of this fine institution,\" Madrazo began, \"know him as Vicente Lombardo Toledano. I know him as a friend.\"\n\nApplause rang through the auditorium. A few students up on the mezzanine waved Cardenista slogans.\n\n\"It is he who has fought for the rights of Mexican workers and the rights of labour. Even in his old age, Señor Toledano remains committed to the working class and the cause of unionism. I am proud to call him a comrade-in-arms.\"\n\nToledano, caked in make-up to hide his infirmity, stepped onto stage to vigorous applause. The press corps snapped flattering photographs of the President and the former Secretary General of the CTM in an embrace.\n\nThe current Secretary General, meanwhile, was not so impressed. Don Fidel Velázquez saw the pictures on the front page of La República a few days later from the comfort of his office.

I'll make sure that this goes no further.\" He wondered if Gutiérrez Barrios knew he was lying.\n\nEcheverría had backed Madrazo to the hilt since his ascension to the presidency, but every passing day it seemed he made new enemies in the party.

Do you know where this is from?\"\n\nSecretary of Public Works Javier Barros Sierra knew. He had skimmed over those words once before, with the same contempt he now heard vocalized. \"The transportation plan for Mexico City?\"\n\n\"Uruchurtu left this piece of shit on my desk,\" said Corona del Rosal, new regent of the Federal District. For emphasis, del Rosal took the binder it came in and threw it all in the trash with a furious shove. The smack of paper and the clang of metal startled Sierra, but it soon gave way to satisfaction.\n\n\"You see the slums, you know these people aren't going to be helped by lanes on highways,\" del Rosal said. \"I'm here to stop this dicking around and cut through the bullshit. Mister Secretary, I want the Metro.\"\n\nSierra smiled. That was it. The Ciudad Mexico Metro, the obvious solution to the city bursting at its seams with slums and sprawl. To put the city on the level of New York, Tokyo, Germania, London. Something Uruchurtu never saw as welcome or necessary. Something about del Rosal pushed him the wrong way, but personal vibes aside, he was one hundred percent right. \"I don't like bullshit either, General. Let's get you one.\"\n\nDel Rosal was happy Sierra wasn't going to kick and scream like a liberal. \"Great. So let's get down to brass tacks. We need a plan, and we need something to make the President sign off on this. ICA, those guys came up with the project, so we'll get them to give us a quote...\"\n\nSierra instantly lost his smile. \"Ingenieros Civiles y Asociados? They're a good company, and I don't doubt Bernardo Quintana could do the job. But they're my former company, and its only fair if you get others -\"\n\n\"Horseshit. You divested when you took this job, and everyone knows you're clean as a whistle. Quintana wanted to pull a Tokyo here for years, and now he's going to do it.

Sierra's previous meeting had unexpectedly gone long. Some Uruchurtu dead-enders had been causing trouble with the metro system. They somehow still refused to do the sensible thing and duck out of the way, and had decided that stopping this project was the hill they wanted to die on. So he called a meeting to make it clear to them they needed to get it together and stop blocking work from starting. But it would be a bad idea to confront them directly. So he needed someone to get the message across discreetly. Someone friendly, someone agreeable, someone talented and skilled at conversation. And that someone had kept him busy in pleasant, amicable conversation until it was too late.\n\nJesús Reyes Heroles, having taken the time to look over some notes, sat up straight across from the desk and took a deep breath. \"So,\" he said, \"if you have that meeting out of the way. . . and I'm still here. . . do you mind if I ask you about something? Something more scientific.\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"I've been doing some thinking,\" Reyes Heroles said, \"and it seems to me that the President is focused on agricultural science. And getting agronomists out is well and good, but there's another industry we should pay attention to.\"\n\n\"One that's under the earth, I take it?\"\n\n\"Exactly. Oil is one of our biggest exports, and it's an industry that is not labor intensive, but one oriented to knowledge and equipment. On top of that, you and I know that chemicals are going to be the future. Especially plastics. When I was a child, rayon stockings blew my mind, and now they use it instead of straw in packages. If we give our young men and women a Mexican Petroleum Institute, we will be able to be on this trend, instead of just fueling it.\"\n\nSierra thought about it. \"You're right. And I agree with you.

Beltán's desk was far too small for the documents strewn across it - as he went to fetch his ballpoint he knocked over a stack of them with his elbow. Madrazo leaned over to help pick up a few.\n\n\"Thank you, Excellency... I'll be honest, this place is falling apart. We're in dire need of repairs, but we're underfunded.\"\n\nPresident Madrazo dismissed the matter, straightening himself on the creaky chair that seemed to suffocate him with its complete disregard for ergonomics. \"Never fear, Señor Director.

I'm grateful for your attempt at finding a solution to the indigenous issue.\"\n\nThe indigenous issue, of course, being what Beltán believed was outright oppression - but he didn't feel the need to engage in theatrics with the Southern Cyclone. Madrazo nodded. \"I think the only way to bring indigenous areas back in parity with the rest of the country is massive infrastructure investment. Though I hear you have some reservations?\"\n\nBeltán turned. \"Excellency, people have the impression that all the Institute is out to do is to completely pave over indigenous identity - only this time it's going to be literal.

His heart sank deep in his chest. A storm would normally wreak havoc by tearing houses, roads, and railways asunder, yet this one was doing the exact opposite. The irony was not lost on him.\n\nPhase one of the proposal involved land surveying of indigenous regions and the construction of roads to link them to nearby towns and cities. Once that was done, phase two would kickstart economic development with a mass public sector building project. Hospitals, police stations, offices, and schools would be built up in each of these newly developed areas. Yet Beltrán couldn't help but wonder how much of this was for economic reasons and how much of it was to force the indigenous to integrate into Mexican society.\n\nWhile it was repulsive to every fibre in his body, there was no question of being able to veto this. His post, however noble, made him no more than a glorified academic.\n\nAll he could do was try to hold back the storm. Whatever it took."

She tried her best to avoid the workers, Mestizos, she called them, while unable to keep her eyes from the rapid transformation happening to her village.\n\nThis time, she was passing by the workers like always when Pascal, her lovely ball of light, grinned like he always did and charged towards the sudden new thing. She called him to come back but she knew it was fruitless to change the boy's mind once he found something interesting. He chatted so excitedly, his hands moving all over the place, his grin infecting the worker Pascal was facing, handing her child something before he finally ran back to her.\n\n\"Na'! Na'! Look!\" He thrusted the poster towards her, a poster of what she thought was the President, a wide smile with the words 'All Aboard the Train of Modernity, No One Left Behind' underneath him.

Beltrán, for his trouble, could not hide the indignation on his face - much apparent by his strained brow.\n\n\"I have much respect for the President, but he is making a mistake. The indigenous have never trusted the government, Licenciado; they want the capacity to make their own decisions, their own autonomy. By going forward with this project, it's only going to exacerbate this discontent.\"\n\nEcheverría spoke, nodding again in deference. \"I agree, General Director. I have my own reservations...\"\n\nBeltrán leaned over his crude desk. \"But will you act on those reservations, Licenciado?\" He had his eyes trained on Echeverría, who remained still in silent consideration.\n\nEcheverría knew something had to be done, it was only right - there wasn't anyone else in the cabinet who would be prepared to take a stand. The State had dealt the indigenous a cruel hand for decades, yes, but this was something else entirely - it was now going to bulldoze their existence and pave it over to carve out a new concrete tapestry in the name of infrastructure. He would make the President see sense.\n\nIn his newfound clarity, Madrazo would also realize that he kept bad company in managing economic policy - Mena and his cronies would lose favor, while he would look decisive.

Some thinking of the offer as a bargain; the best they'll get. In return for expressing this, though, they were confronted by accusations of selling out, and that they should hold firm.\n\nMadrazo could see the burning hot debates going around the table of representatives.

 MEX_Madrazo_DS.18.desc:0 "坐在冷冰冰的马桶上，阿图罗竭尽全力噙住泪水。但是最终，他失败了，泪珠从脸颊上划过。在不久之前，他失去了实习医生的职位，此事令他大吃一惊。他甚至完全不记得自己当时说了什么。正式的解雇理由是他的表现不如预期，而且在工作场所之外行为不端。但他心里清楚，真正的原因是他曾发出抗议。对方毫不掩饰地对他作出政治威胁，极力强调职员在体制内的代表性。他在不知不觉中走到了卫生间，因为他知道卫生间这时候一般没有人。他的一举一动宛如机械，直到他关上了隔间的门，让自己尽可能身处安全环境之中，才得以停止。是否只有此刻，他才能作出反应并释放情绪？他的同志们会如何看待他？有人能理解他的痛苦吗？还是会嘲笑他的懦弱和幼稚？\n\n阿图罗拿起一把卫生纸擦眼泪，这纸只有薄薄一层。需求清单上曾列明需要改善卫生间设施，而且还排在非常前列的位置，但事到如今，看着自己的泪水浸透这张薄纸，这一切都显得无关紧要。阿图罗开始思考他当下的糟糕处境，如同那隔间门外肮脏的镜子一般。无数个日月的辛劳和学习才让他得到了这个位置。无数的血泪和汗水就这么白白牺牲了。但他做错什么了吗？根本没有。阿图罗把一大堆擦过眼泪的卫生纸冲进了马桶里，毁灭了记录着他的悲伤的证据。既然错的不是他，那错的就是这个地方。人生不是只有医学这个出路，他尚且还称得上聪明伶俐，年富力强，完全可以重新去学些别的。就算要继续走这条路，去美国发展的机遇也好得多。他的英语水平一向比同龄人要好。\n\n有人敲了敲隔间门。“老兄，我现在很急。你还要在里面呆多久？”\n\n阿图罗一言不发地打开了门，走了出来。“完事了，我不会再呆在这里了。”"

 MEX_Madrazo_DS.19.desc:0 "The conference room was packed, and not because there were many people from a singular organization. On the contrary, it was because every law enforcement agency in Mexico had sent a single representative, all congregating inside the room. From the DFS, to PJF, to the Federal District police, they were all here. All gathered for one purpose; to thoroughly root out the enemy, the strikers.\n\nEach group offered their perspectives, debated, discussed, argued, drew frantically on their notepads to provide their plan. All to take down the AMM and AMMRI members who still stood and refused to cease their meaningless struggle. From the many ideas, from outright sweeps across every street with a hint of striking activity to targeted raids, they all merged into two camps.\n\nThe first, the sweeps. Making an example of each and every striker that still continued to threaten public order, arresting them for years at minimum. This would be costly. This would be long. This would require another reminder to the general public how much power the law had. But it would be strong, wide-ranging, and prevent any notion of another rising from the ashes.\n\nThe second, targeting only those at the top of the movement. Each leader would be broadcasted, their crime of spreading chaos and disorder being printed in each paper, and they would all be damned. This was less costly, faster, and could be done quietly without flexing the presence of the law too much. However, it would not guarantee another movement being able to rise up. Those who had refused to give in could reorganize, flee, or wait for another opportunity.\n\nAs each side made their points, and each counter-argument to their opposing side, the room finally decided on a course of action."

Rain struck the windows in a constant patter, as a lone bead of water periodically dripped from a kitchen sink tap. He hung his soaked hat and coat up on the hanger, one ear perked at the sound of crackled, muffled speech from the sitting room. \"Paco, is that you?\" came the voice of his grandmother as he entered, arms akimbo to embrace her.\n\n\"Abuelito...\" Francisco grinned, patting her on the shoulder. His grandfather sat all stiff in his rocking chair, and being infirm as he was - severe arthritis - he did not stand to receive Francisco, both instead sharing a handshake in the midst of the lit hearth, a fire raging to take the chill off his grandfather's feeble bones. Paco took a spare seat and gestured vaguely to the wireless. \"What's on tonight?\"\n\n\"Have you not been listening to President Madrazo's updates?\"\n\nHe opened his mouth to question why his grandparents - staunch conservatives, who held anything remotely leftist in anathema - were so interested in what the embodiment of what they hated had to say, but was shushed.\n\n\"I empathise very dearly with the struggles of our junior doctors,\" the President spoke, \"and we are making good progress to listen to their concerns and to make amends through these recent negotiations...\"\n\nNegotiations? What negotiations? The government was talking to them? And he sounded quite sincere, too, warm. Not like the usual bureaucratic crap that merely registered as noise in his mind whenever he heard them over the radio, or on the television.\n\nHe felt heard."

A peak out of the window showed the entire street, still flickering, still illuminated. They realized in confusion, it was only this building where the flickers had been halted.\n\nA woman pushed open the gates of the flicker-less building, surveying the street once more, left and right turns for any police or DFS crackdown, yet, silence. Turning back, a simple message penned for the occupants of the AMMRI headquarters, and by the Comisión Federal de Electricidad.\n\n'ELECTRICAL SERVICE HAS BEEN DISCONNECTED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.' The CFE was benevolent enough to leave a number for their questions or grievances to be aired out too, so the note was delivered to everyone gathered in the first floor, and a quick drive to the nearest house of a staffer with a telephone was conducted. The dials were spun, the call was directed to its specified designation, and the noises filled the caller's ear."

Yet, even with all the benefits he argued for and won that got added onto the deal, many still were not accepted. The benefits not accepted would cause a stir in the AMM, the representative was sure of it. Going even further, the representative thought deeper as he skimmed the document once more, the movement had a solid chance of rejecting this in a vote.\n\nHis concerns were relayed to his counterpart, and the virus of thought spread to him as well.

 MEX_Madrazo_DS.23.desc:0 "Above Mexico City, the beating sun bakes the high dry ground and bites the people in oppressive, heavy air. Every step creates a dust cloud that joins the smog of the bustling capital. In one corner of the city, an organized group of medical professionals march in circles, kicking up dust and fuss with their placards and demands held high. The AMMRI members marching are experts at this point, veterans of their fight against the government. Everything was going as planned; the only problem was the reception. Besides them and their dust, the street was empty. There were no journalists, police, or even curious citizens going about their day. Only the sun was to witness what happened next.\n\nA man-made smoke descended upon the striking men. Fired from grenade launchers or rolled onto the cobbled streets, the chemical clouds mixed with the dust and chaos signaled the end of the peaceful display. The riot police thundered onto the scene like a storm. There was no negotiation. There were no warnings or time to disperse. The police, with their masks and clubs, were sent there by their masters to send a message. The sun beat down on their dark uniforms, it was sweat covered hands which beat down on the protesters. The velvet glove was to be replaced with the iron rod.\n\nWith their mastery of medicine and vows to heal others the AMMRI was no match in a fight against the hardened police of the capital. In quick succession, doctors and interns alike were shoved, beaten, and handcuffed until submission or retreat. When the smoke cleared, the devastation wrought left no evidence of the supposed collective bargaining power of the AMMRI. Caked in blood, sweat, and dust most of the men just protesting minutes before would scramble home to lick their wounds, never again facing the state or challenging the Revolution's institutions."

Skipping over the less than desirable figures of how many were fired, or how quality of care fell in the hospitals that turned operational once more.\n\nHe flipped the page, and the video feed shifted. Screams from the picket lines as they were battered and beaten away by law enforcement or those aligned with state unions. Though, they attempted a charge at the bus less than fifty meters away, carrying a batch of FSTSE doctors and interns being bussed in. Their charge failed, resulting only in batons smashing against their skulls, their arms, their ribs.\n\nAnother page flip, then another, and another. Each time, a different video, a different story, but the same topic. Hospitals were coming back online, each one that did having the extra burden of supplementing those that still did not. The party was doing what it did best, and kept trying to brute-force the strike away. The PRI made sure the hospitals would function, by any means, to crush the strength of the strike."

 MEX_Madrazo_DS.25.desc:0 "Another huge rally in Mexico City, organized as usual by the CNOP, but this time with the FSTSE front-and-centre. Ticker-tape, small refreshments, massive numbers of attendees—some even related to the medical profession—and press coverage in all the newspapers and on all the television channels the authorities could get hold of. Nothing out of the ordinary, so far.\n\nBut there was a change, at least a superficial one. Ordinarily, if people opposed to the PRI were even mentioned at a rally like that, they would be referred to as \"fascists\" or \"communists\" or some such. But this time, there was a lot of \"solidarity\" at the rally with the protesting medics.\n\nPractically every speaker from the CNOP, especially those from the FSTSE, drew near to the striking doctors at least in word. All of them insisted that something was, in fact, wrong with the way medical professionals were treated and paid. Some of the FSTSE functionaries actually had horror stories of their own to share. With these as the prime exhibit, they argued for improvements in the medical system.\n\nTo anyone with the ability to read between the lines, however, something was extremely clear aside from the usual performative calls for improvement. The FSTSE was laying claim to the solution of this problem. No external union, no faction unaligned with the CNOP or the PRI more generally could provide medical professionals with relief. A better hospital system would only be constructed under the aegis of the FSTSE."
