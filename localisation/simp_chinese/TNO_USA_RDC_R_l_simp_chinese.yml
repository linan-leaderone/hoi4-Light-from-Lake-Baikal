 USA_George_Romney: "乔治·罗姆尼"
 POLITICS_GEORGE_ROMNEY_DESC:0 "George W. Romney was born to all-American parents in the Mormon colonies of Mexico. From an early age, he interacted with strong themes of religiosity, a factor that would influence him later in life. Eventually due to the Mexican Revolution of 1910, his family fled back to the United States moving from city to city, struggling financially during the Depression years, until ultimately arriving in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nAs an adult, he worked in several part-time jobs and attempted to secure a college education several times - failing each round, eventually ending up in Detroit where he worked for the American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), which gained him his claim to fame as the chief spokesman within the automobile industry at the height of World War II. Dejected following America's coerced defeat, he would go on to work in the private sector - first at Nash-Kelvinator in '48 and then as CEO of it's successor, the American Motors Corporation in '54.\n\nBy 1960, Romney tired of the corporate life, inspired by his strong religious convictions he ran for Governor of Michigan in '61 as the candidate for the Republican-Democrats, re-elected multiple times he eventually took the side of the marginalized in the Civil Rights Movement arguing against party dissenters like Goldwater and Dixiecrat opposition figures like Strom Thurmond - even going as far as to condemn the NPP for harboring 'traitorous elements' in response to a speech by the Sovereigntist leader Byers in his home state of Utah.\n\nNow after a tumultuous decade, Romney represents peace, stability, order and good old Christian America, leading the Conservative wing of the RDCs, George W. Romney has ascended to the ranks of the Oval Office intent on building an America for everyone , strengthened by Christ and steadfast in spirit."

They all knew what he wanted to speak to them about, it had been on their minds since the networks had called the race for Romney. His two daughters, Lynn and Jane, and two sons, George and Willard, looked up at him from the couch. Lenore, his wife, stood behind them, her arms embracing the fours' shoulders.\n\n\"I don't think I expected to get to his point, but we did, and this is a big step,\" George began, \"It will be nothing like when I was governor. The step up from the Michigan governor's mansion to the White House is immense and the eyes of the entire nation will be on all of us. We have to live up to those standards.\" He met the steady eyes of his children. All adults and familiar with political life, they knew the stakes and requirements.\n\n\"You have big shoes to fill, George,\" Lenore said, clearly proud of her husband, \"You'll be sitting in the same chair as Washington and Lincoln did, guiding the nation forward and solving problems. Despite the challenge, I know you'll make us all proud.\" As one, George's family embraced him and for a moment the world seemed a little less heavy.\n\n\"Thank you, dear,\" He said, genuinely grateful to have his wife's support. He could struggle on despite many obstacles, but Lenore's support was foundational to his every effort, \"I'm blessed to be surrounded by such a loving family.\"\n\nEven as the family embraced, solemnity persisted. They all recognized that George had become something more than a man or a father with his election. For now, however, they celebrated their father's victory."

 rom.2.desc:0 "George Romney was still settling into the White House, finding it at times historically asphyxiating. How could one think clearly in the presidency with the eyes of Lincoln, Jefferson and Washington watching? It would certainly be an adjustment, but Romney meant to do good work and would not let transition difficulties slow him down. One of the first items on his agenda was a meeting with Donald Rumsfeld.\n\nRumsfeld had had a solid career in the House of Representatives, his keen eye assessing flaws in America's military machine that some would have preferred to stay hidden. More than that, he was a good manager and a good judge of people, someone Romney could rely on. There were certain members of the RD Coalition, such as Goldwater and his allies, who the President knew he could not effectively reach and that was where Rumsfeld came in.\n\n\"You want me to be your ambassador to the conservatives, Mr. President?\" Rumsfeld looked surprised. While certainly a man of the right, he did not consider himself one of Goldwater's cohorts.\n\n\"More than that, Rumsfeld,\" Romney replied, his keen eyes bright with energy. A manager all his life, he knew exactly what someone like Rumsfeld could do for him, \"Conservatives like you a lot more than me so if I need them, you'll be the one making the appeal. I can't be everywhere or know everything,\" He said, meeting his subordinate's eyes, \"And I need men I can trust to be loyal, go where I can't, and figure out problems that I don't have time to get a handle on. That sounds like you.\"\n\n\"You're very kind, Mr. President, and I'll be happy to serve the nation however it needs me.\""

Each had left their mark on the man, rendering him a consummate Washington insider and an excellent ally to have.\n\n\"Mr. Schultz, thank you for coming,\" Romney said, shaking the man's hand, \"I believe you know why I asked you here. I'd be willing to offer you a position as Secretary of the Treasury, if you'd take it. I think we could do great things for this country together.\"\n\n\"Then I have to ask, Mr. President, what would you have your Treasury Department doing? I'll follow orders to the T, but I like to know what I'm getting into before I agree to jump.\" This was a negotiation, just like any George had faced in business, and as always, he knew who he was selling to.\n\n\"Fiscal responsibility, cost-saving measures...\" Romney said, seeing interest grow in Schultz. The man liked to pare budgets down, a passion the President respected and the country needed. Romney's programs would be expensive and he did not want any superfluous or wasteful spending.\n\n\"Making sure the taxpayer is getting full bang for his buck,\" Schultz said, nodding, \"That's something the country could benefit from. I'm your man, Mr. President.\"\n\nSmiling Romney rose and shook the man's hand. Schultz would not be controversial in the Senate, knowing many of its occupants, and could expect to sail to confirmation. Pleased at another small victory for the administration, Romney turned to his next task. He had a long day ahead."

 rom.4.desc:0 "One of George Romney's favorite aspects of politics was the people it brought him into contact with. He had learned long ago that he did not have all the answers but by consulting enough of the right people he could get a lot closer to the truth. Edward Brooke, the first Black Governor of Massachusetts, was one such man Romney relied on, which was what had brought the governor to the Oval Office today.\n\n\"Edward, I want you to be my Attorney General. I need someone reliable, good-hearted, who will use the powers of the office to make this country better and fairer. I can't think of a better candidate than you given your experience.\" Hardly given to flattery, Romney spoke from the heart as he had long admired Brooke for his principled approach to politics.\n\n\"I appreciate the offer, Mr. President, but I have a duty to my constituents, to the Commonwealth,\" Governor Brooke seemed pained even as he declined. He was still an ambitious man after all and could have a much more direct effect on the world from the office of the AG than Boston.\n\n\"I understand that, Ed, and I appreciate your concern for the people of Massachusetts, they're lucky to have you in office. I just don't think there's anyone else who can do this job like you would, or have your unique perspective.\" Putting his hands up in surrender, Brooke smiled and chuckled.\n\n\"All right Mr. President, enough, enough! You've won me over, sir. If you'll have me, and the Senate approves, it would be my honor to serve in your administration.\" Their business done, the two men chatted amiably, a warm familiarity between them."

 rom.5.t:0 "The Senatorial Roadblock"
 rom.5.desc:0 "\"President Romney has selected a most concerning candidate for Attorney General,\" Senator Strom Thurmond said to reporters, surrounded by his allies in the NPP, \"Governor Brooke is neither qualified nor temperamentally suited for such a powerful office. His personal conflicts and prioritization of politics over the proper and impartial administration of justice compel a \"No\" vote from me.\" In another part of the Senate building, Senator Barry Goldwater was giving a similar statement to reporters.\n\n\"I share Governor Brooke's commitments to justice and the law. However I have grave concerns over his views of federal power. The constitution shackles the federal government from overextending its powers, whether that be for good or ill. If I am not convinced that Governor Brooke understands these limitations, I do not believe he is a suitable candidate for the position.\"\n\nIn the Oval Office, news of senators' opposition to Brooke's nomination rolled in. Some were upset a friend of theirs had not been selected, a few like Goldwater had philosophical concerns, others like Thurmond recognized Brooke as an opponent to their entire program and quite a few would never tolerate a Black Attorney General.\n\nGeorge Romney was a pleasant man, not given to anger or vindictiveness. So, when he began calling senators, and their friends and allies, it was not thunder and lightning he brought but friendliness and persuasion. A life in politics and business had given him innumerable strings to pull and favors to trade. As the calls wore on and the charm offensive continued, Romney could see in his mind the \"no\" and undecided votes switching over to support Brooke."

 rom.6.desc:0 "\"Congratulations, Attorney-General Brooke,\" Romney said effusively as he shook his friend's hand. Brooke, a broad smile on his face, was still not quite used to the new title. After the trouble in the Senate, he had half-expected his nomination to stagnate, or perhaps even be withdrawn. A lesser man than George Romney might have backed down from an early fight with the Senate, not wanting to burn bridges he might have to cross over later, but he had stuck by Brooke.\n\n\"Now that that bit of trouble has been dealt with,\" Romney said, spreading a sheaf of proposals across the Resolute Desk in front of his deputy, \"I have plenty of work for the Department of Justice to begin taking a look at,\" He tapped his finger on a folder labelled \"Anti-Discrimination Measures\", \"I think this will be a particularly productive avenue to pursue. What use is a Civil Rights Act if no one is enforcing it?\"\n\nBrooke nodded happily. After years in state government, he was eager to get onto the national stage. With the full powers of the United States Department of Justice, he was sure he'd be able to make a major dent in crime, discrimination and prejudice.\n\n\"I'd be more than happy to make such issues a priority of my office,\" Brooke replied, \"Civil rights enforcement has been a back-burner issue for far too long and I'm heartened that this administration will be taking it seriously. We'll face blowback and criticism from the right though, even some people within the coalition-\"\n\n\"You let me worry about them, Ed,\" Romney replied, \"You focus on doing your job and I'll handle the peanut gallery. When people see that our approach is working and healing divisions, only the hard-line bigots will be left opposing us, and I'm comfortable with that.\""

 rom.7.desc:0 "George Romney frankly felt a little at ease around the hard-eyed military men who made up much of the United States government. His faith encouraged non-violence and he tended to disdain the more conservative politics of America's soldiers. Nevertheless, as part of his eternal quest to soothe his conservative allies within the coalition, today he found himself meeting retired Admiral John McCain Jr, a small, thin man with steely eyes.\n\nThe son of a decorated Admiral, McCain had followed in his father's footsteps, serving in the Pacific Theater as a submarine commander. He had been known as an effective, aggressive commander who pioneered new techniques for submarine warfare that would be crucial in the event of another conflict with the Empire of Japan. While not a politician, conservative hawks recognized in McCain Jr. an ally and kindred spirit. Romney was not so sure until they got onto the topic of family.\n\n\"My son is in the navy as well,\" McCain offered, \"Caused some trouble at the Naval Academy like his old man but he straightened up and his superiors tell me he's a credit to the family name.\" Generations in service to the United States, Romney reflected, a family putting itself at risk for the Republic. A swell of admiration rose within him.\n\n\"Would you mind explaining a few more points about our naval positioning within the Pacific, Admiral?\" He asked, \"It seems to leave us vulnerable in a few places...\" His eyes blazing with interest, McCain leapt into a detailed analysis of the United States' position in the Pacific without any notes or preparation. Impressed, Romney was content to sit back and listen. Their meeting concluded, the Admiral prepared to leave but the President had one final question for the old sea-dog."

If Vice President Rumsfeld is Romney's olive branch to the party's burgeoning right flank, then placing Lodge at the helm of the State Department is a sop to the President's Northeastern backers, who have furnished his candidacy with money and personnel.\n\nAbsent since Lodge's father helmed the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee during the days of Wilson, it seems the Brahmins of Boston have returned to the helm of State."

The former libertarian, much moderated, seemed to bounce with a nervous energy as he sat in the Oval Office, \"I look forward to working with you on the Presidential Council on the Independent Sector.\"\n\nThe Independent Sector was a lynchpin of Romney's new approach to politics. In George's opinion, America had been built on the back of volunteerism and private organizations. In the modern age, rather than double down on a centralized federal approach to solving America's problems, Romney wanted to try something new based on older principles. A collaboration between nonprofits, volunteer groups and corporate giving programs could have extremely positive far-reaching effects if the right person were in charge.\n\n\"Absolutely, Mr. President, \"Cornuelle replied, \"Granted, I think you're more of an expert on the concept of the Independent Sector, but I'll be the best salesman for the concept that I can be.\"\n\n\"Maybe I do know more about it, for now, than you, Rich, maybe I don't. And I'd love to give it my full attention, but the demands of this office prevent me. A good President, or manager, needs to know when to delegate. I don't need a salesman for this, I need a leader.\"\n\n\"You make a good point there, Mr. President,\" The ex-libertarian answered, rubbing his chin thoughtfully, \"I appreciate the focus on problem-solving rather than just repeating stale dogma, and I do think this will do a lot of good for people who need help.

Getting corporations to buy in had been seen as one of the program's major stumbling blocks, but with the participation of a few, and success, more would be sure to follow.\n\n\"That's excellent news, Richard,\" The President responded, moving to the next step of the program, \"Did you have any thoughts about how to encourage more volunteering by citizens? Rates have been stagnant for some time now...\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Cornuelle said, producing a list from his pocket, \"The corporate representatives suggested a program where volunteering a certain number of hours leads to paid holidays. There is also the option to publicize the program as much as possible and get America interested.\"\n\n\"Both good ideas,\" Romney responded, \"But there must be a way to get high-earners, movers and shakers in communities invested. Maybe some sort of tax credit or deduction for volunteering work or organization?\"\n\nCornuelle nodded, his pen a blur as he noted the idea and began spinning new proposals off it. The office was a blur of activity and conversation as the two men hammered out a few proposals for the Independent Sector before other matters demanded the President's attention."

They got down to business immediately.\n\n\"I appreciate the invitation, Mr. President,\" Cornuelle said, remaining perched at the edge of the couch and studying Romney, \"The good that volunteerism can do would be much greater with the support of the federal government working hand in hand to alleviate social ills.\" He was heartened to see Romney nodding along.\n\n\"Please, call me George, and I hope I can call you Richard?\" Cornuelle nodded and the President relaxed, an easy smile forming, \"I couldn't agree more. We've tried governmental alleviation of social problems and, while some gains have been made, other wounds have only deepened with nothing to show for it but spent money. I think a new approach, as you described, could help a great number of Americans trapped in the pit.\"\n\n\"To the specifics then, George,\" Cornuelle said with a wry grin, \"Corporate giving programs, as well as making every effort to encourage volunteering and social engagement are natural first steps. But the establishment of the Independent Sector, to bring non-profits, businesses and community leaders under one collaborative roof should be our highest priority.\"\n\nThe two spoke for about an hour more as Cornuelle laid out his plans. Romney intervened periodically with insightful questions and occasionally suggestions regarding organizational structures and cost-saving clearly inspired by his time in business.

I want legislation moving through Congress to break through the resistance we're still facing in some quarters.\" Heads were nodding and Humphrey took the opportunity to speak up.\n\n\"I think there's plenty of appetite among more liberal quarters of the Senate for more action on civil rights. We can talk about desegregation efforts and enforcement, further antidiscrimination statutes—\"\n\n\"What about bussing?\" Romney broke in, provoking glances between the audience of senators, \"We can desegregate today, it's just a matter of administration and transportation. If we want to set a moral, and efficient, example I think that's the best path forward.\"\n\nEveryone in the room knew that bussing was politically risky, with parents opposing their children being sent to different schools often on the other side of the city from their home, in addition to racist opposition to school integration. But it was also probably the strongest tool the government had to force progress in the face of Southern non-compliance.

If they won't obey court orders, maybe more fines and litigation will change their tune.\"\n\nBrooke nodded, accepting the order even as he had misgivings. He had always believed the Attorney-General had a duty to be impartial and dispassionate, not on an issue 'like a bloodhound'. Slightly troubled, he left the Oval Office to begin his work.\n\nFred Miller, superintendent of Lamar County, Georgia schools, leaned back into his chair. Things in the district were just how his predecessor had left them in 1952. Certainly, the district existed under an official desegregation order, but the federal officials had accepted his stated reasons for delay, seeming to lose interest. Abruptly, as he was beginning to doze off, his secretary barged in.\n\n\"Fred? There's a letter from the Department of Justice for you.\" Curious, he perused it. His eyes widened at the mention of 'contempt of court' and positively popped when he saw what the letter had to say about criminal and financial penalties.

The district served a largely poor section of Baltimore and clearly lacked funding.\n\n\"Thank you, Principal Morris,\" George Romney said as the man's prattle came to an end, \"You've given me a great deal to think about and I can promise you this administration will work to make your students' futures brighter.\" A firm handshake terminated his visit.\n\nBack in Washington, Romney and his cabinet immediately began delving into the issue of education reform. Schools' funding was uneven, depending on aid from the state and the property taxes of the surrounding community, leaving richer districts far better off than poor ones. That gap would have to be bridged if any kind of improvement in education was to be made.\n\nThe federal government would pick up the tab, the President and his cabinet decided. Uncle Sam's munificence would brighten the lives and education of innumerable children across the country. In order to track the program's success and make sure money was being spent properly, federal testing and curriculum standards would follow the new federal funds.\n\nThis new policy would be a political winner. Parents and teachers would both appreciate the new funds and resources even if children and the unions grumbled about the new testing and standards.

 USA_wfb_64_financial_monetary_conference_desc: "1964年，为复兴、巩固OFN以应对下一个十年的新挑战，美国政府提议进行全方位改革，得到强烈反响，但各国在诸如美元体系、自贸区、国际银行等细节问题上仍存分歧。因此，各自由国家的大使月复一月地举行会谈，交换意见与共识。他们在一处展开的讨论，自然也会在另一处结束，而这个地方正是位于新罕布什尔州布雷顿森林的华盛顿山酒店。\n\n太平洋与大西洋沿岸各国的代表犹如奥林匹斯山的众神般齐聚一堂，汇集于阿帕拉契亚山脉之下，其决断将以雷鸣贯耳之势传遍世界每一个角落，让每一个人都知晓地一清二楚。然而，他们也正如希腊神话中各路神仙那般，彼此争执不断，甚至有可能无功而返。在接下里的日子里，自由世界的领导人将做出决定：团结一致，还是分道扬镳？"

 USA_wfb_64_bretton_woods_desc: "不管发生了多少变化，不可否认的是，自由世界已经迎来了一个新时代。\n\n真正的变化体现在其手段上。随着更多现金的投入，剑正在被磨利，而盾也在被强化。关税壁垒彻底消除，自由世界的天秤伴随着来自远方的资金叮当作响。在协议的支持下，自由世界的金库免于遭受最严重的顽疾。自由国家组织新生的兄弟姐妹在金融、民用和经济事务上注入了新活力，并在同等程度上运用力量和仁慈，使得它的臂膀延伸到更远的奴役世界，如今，美国巨大的潜力储备将一个民主国家与其他民主国家联系在了一起。\n\n在联系变得不可分割之前，还有更多的工作要做。然而，通过所谓的布雷顿森林体系正是开创这一体制的关键节点。"
 USA_wfb_64_political_necessity: "政治需要"
 USA_wfb_64_political_necessity_desc: "无论情愿与否，我们都要处理民权问题。正是因为尼克松总统对必要的改革缺乏主动，才导致当下的危机，而危机尚存，美国不可能聚焦于其他事情。然而，与某些人不同，我们不热衷于种族隔离主义者边缘化。毕竟，让他们闭嘴只会让围绕这场辩论产生的怒火烧到其他地方。我们需要一个折中方案——至少不让其中一方感到恼火的折中方案。"
 USA_wfb_64_token_reform: "象征性改革"
 USA_wfb_64_token_reform_desc: "经慎重考虑，本内特总统得出结论：推行适度改革方案就是最好的做法。通过一些新法律来保护受极端不公行为伤害的非裔美国人，我们就能向他们证明，他们的呼声我们在倾听。这一目标的实现，可能要稍微得罪种族隔离主义者，但只要我们不越过红线，淡化某些过于激进的议题，我们就能在不惹恼大多数人的前提下，解决这个问题。"

 USA_wfb_64_codified_protections_desc: "虽然曾积极地赋予非裔美国人权力和自由，但是这些权利在立法者一次又一次地操纵和创造性地解释法律中被剥夺。我们的精力应聚焦于对联邦法律的修正，以明确、清晰的方式写成的法典让这些美国公民得到权利、保障和保护。通过修补过去压迫他们的法律漏洞，我们能确保少数族裔获得与美国其他族裔都享有的基本保护。"

 USA_wfb_64_crack_down_on_resistance_desc: "是时候肃清街道了。全国各地的抗议和骚乱仍在继续，如果我们要保障文明的辩论，终结这些持续的动乱很有必要。警察经费将会增加，他们将被派去逮捕最恶劣的滋事者，并命令其余的人回家。为了避免被指责为政治偏袒，我们将打击两方的暴力行为。如果他们中的任何一方想要被倾听，就要像成年人一样行事。"
 USA_wfb_64_voting_station_inspection: "投票站检查"
 USA_wfb_64_voting_station_inspection_desc: "选民压制是民权活动家们热衷的主要议题。少数族裔往往因为无数晦涩难懂的规定、混乱的登记程序和缺乏非英语语言材料而无法投票。我们应当专门就这些问题派出检查员，以确保每个人都能行使自身的民主权利。这应该会让我们在民权运动中更受欢迎，而不至于惹恼种族隔离主义者——毕竟，我们只是在执行民众理应享有的权利。"

 USA_wfb_64_one_great_push_desc: "本内特总统希望尽快为民权法案之争画上句号。为筹备一系列立法公投，他召集立法者不断开展会议。总统认为，如果我们能快速解决此事，这一议题就能淡出舆论圈，比起继续拖延下去，这么做更能减少种族隔离主义者对政府的迁怒。不要再游手好闲了——一劳永逸地解决这件事吧。"
 USA_wfb_64_dont_rock_boat: "不要惹事"
 USA_wfb_64_dont_rock_boat_desc: "在深思熟虑过后，本内特总统决定，以谨慎政策应对民权问题才是最好的举措。隔离派的声音不能忽视，而强迫他们改变行事方式自然会被视作暴政。我们仍然可以通过一些基本改革，对少数族裔社区提供保护，但他们的愿望可不止如此。可再怎么说，我们选民中很大一部分都是隔离派，党的需求也不能不照顾。"
 USA_wfb_64_check_committees: "控制委员会"
 USA_wfb_64_check_committees_desc: "在绝大多数美国人的认识中，立法过程始于也终于椭圆形办公室：总统在闪光灯和重要盟友面前，将国会通过的法案正式批准。但有些事实可能是因为丑闻不断或是不够光彩，常常被回忆录和小报忽略，但真相就是法案要想见到国会山的光明，就必须先闯过各种五花八门的委员会。精明的观察家会指出，美国的立法过程正是因为这样才变得无比晦涩难懂……但在华盛顿的政治博弈家看来，如此的繁琐细节是非常趁手的工具，足够把他们不喜欢的法案挡在国会山之外。\n\n本内特总统深知，他的对手会想尽办法利用这惊人的官僚大棒阻碍《民权法案》，他正打算要向相关委员会的共和党-民主党联盟同僚发出呼吁，请求他们的支持。"
 USA_wfb_64_rally_congress_votes: "获取国会支持"
 USA_wfb_64_rally_congress_votes_desc: "若要解决民权法案的问题，我们就必须获得议会的支持，确保其能批准必要的立法提案。好在，本内特总统颇具魅力，加之党在该议题上秉承中立态度，或许共和党、进步党团和国民党团议员最终都能就此达成一致。为此，我们就需要和议会内的各个派系和利益集团达成若干共识，以此拉拢更多摇摆不定的人士。不过，只要保证满足他们的一些私利，拉票应该就不会有多难。获得这些人的支持后，我们就能放手为国家前途做必要之事了。"

 USA_wfb_64_right_to_free_speech_desc: "言论自由是美国社会的根基。无论剥夺了谁的言论自由，无论他们的思想如何，都严重违背了国父们建立这个国家的初衷。不论是种族隔离主义者还是民权活动家都用“应受谴责”、“令人恶心”、“非美国”一类词来称呼对方，然而事实是，我们必须允许他们双方都能发声。我们也许不喜欢他们的言论，但是我们要誓死捍卫他们说话的权利——无论“他们”是谁，也无论“他们想要说的”是什么。"
 USA_wfb_64_keep_it_vague: "含糊其辞"
 USA_wfb_64_keep_it_vague_desc: "我们知道民权活动家们想要被倾听，我们也能听见他们的声音。我们应对他们保证：他们对于我们而言很重要，我们愿意做需要做的事情。最终，我们会对他们做出承诺，并在某个时刻兑现承诺；当合适时机出现时亦是如此。那些承诺会是什么？什么时候会得到实现？别着急，政府知道自己在干什么。民众不需要担心，他们一定会明白我们正在尽己所能。也许吧。"
 USA_wfb_64_state_inspections: "州内检查"
 USA_wfb_64_state_inspections_desc: "南方各州相当抵触联邦政府对当地选举流程的监管。虽然那里的基建和立法系统对少数人群确实不甚友好，但我们若让联邦政府显出独裁姿态，那就会致使极右翼的国家进步公约获得更多支持。我们能做的就是鼓励州政府自行审查体制，从州一级开展调查，根除歧视行为。许多人认为，如此行事会导致各州内部不可避免地出现歧视，改变不了什么，但从另一方面来看，为了将变革落到实处，不仅要由上至下的推动，还必须要从基层做起。"
 USA_wfb_64_step_by_step: "稳步前进"
 USA_wfb_64_step_by_step_desc: "常言道：小心驶得万年船。历史已经证明，最成功的变革皆非一蹴而就，而是历经多年稳步改革才达成的。在推进法案落实、取悦民权人士的时候，我们也要保住种族隔离主义者的支持。为此，我们就不能一次性推行全部改革措施，而是要稳步推进——这样一来，改革不仅不会导致文化快速转变进而吓倒保守派，也能让进步派放心地看到社会正在逐步变化。"
 USA_wfb_64_acceptable_solution: "可接受的答案"
 USA_wfb_64_acceptable_solution_desc: "权衡再三后，我们制定了一套可能让民权问题双方都接受的策略。两方都对我们提出了批评与顾虑——或许行事方式确有偏颇，但这不足挂齿。重要的是，我们提出的法案旨在让大多数美国人都能平等相处，同时，其所倡导的各类立法项照顾到了民权人士和种族隔离者各自的需求与呼吁。由此，我们能证明，妥协之道才是解决美国社会问题的关键。"
 USA_wfb_64_voices_of_people: "人民之声"
 USA_wfb_64_voices_of_people_desc: "关于民权法案具体含义的争论无穷无尽，但最能体会到其意义的莫过于那些法案直接受益者。纵观全国，成千上万的非裔美国人和其他少数人群正因为被政治系统拒之门外而对政事淡漠不已。如果我们要让美国团结起来，我们就应该与这些人群接触，让他们直接参与地方与全国性的政治活动。我们要既要将他们的诉求传达出去，也要让这些人参政议政。"
 USA_wfb_64_leave_to_experts: "术业有专攻"
 USA_wfb_64_leave_to_experts_desc: "比起远在首都的政治家，地方长官和当地政客远比他们清楚如何实施民权相关的政策。虽然我们还是能鼓励他们去采取更为进步的行事手段，但还是要放手让地方自行敲定改革细则。毕竟，他们都是各州的民选领导人，所以显然有能力去因地制宜、因材施策。"
 USA_wfb_64_subcommittees_subcommittees: "繁文缛节"
 USA_wfb_64_subcommittees_subcommittees_desc: "美国历史上不乏形同虚设、人人阳奉阴违的法律。看看重建时期的修正案就知道了——考虑到总统打算在冗长的清单上再添一笔，这其中可有可无的法条真是折磨人。\n\n总统与顾问和议会内党员讨论过后一致认为，美国政治体制已无力进一步承担推动民权发展带来的负面影响。政府没有将资本与精力用来反制猖獗的通胀、打压世界唯一自由灯塔脚下滋生的法西斯主义，反而浪费再促成分裂、创造新的对立与矛盾。\n\n然而，总统也不能向公众显露出事不关己的态度。有鉴于此，他拿出了除拖延性演说之外第二好用的政客法宝：堆砌繁文缛节。如果你想在尝试过一切可能性之后达成什么，就得改换名头…"

 USA_wfb_64_leave_door_open_desc: "虽然在民权活动家可能觉得政府在处理民权问题上略显保守，但等到之后再放开也未尝不可。本内特总统一贯坚持改变并非一簇而就的原则，虽然政府还要处理其他事务，但还是能继续开展讨论、鼓励民权事业支持者为未来的改革努力。藉此，我们就能取悦民权人士，也不至于疏远种族隔离主义者。"
 USA_wfb_64_lock_and_key: "到此为止"
 USA_wfb_64_lock_and_key_desc: "我们应申明，民权事务皆已安排妥当——至少在可预见的未来是如此。我们已经在这方面投入了太多了精力，现在该处理其他更为紧迫的政务了。民权人士或许会对此颇有微词，但他们至少应该会承认其境遇已改善了不少；同时，就此收尾也能安抚迪克西派，显出不会抛弃自己或他们价值观的姿态。"

 USA_wfb_64_empower_democrats_desc: "政府日趋保守，这对本内特总统来说可谓天赋良机。许多人对共和党——其在战败后元气大伤——忽然又有了信心。就现况来说，我们有了改头换面的再出山、重回美国政治舞台中心的机会。拜民主党盟友所赐，我们在这二十年间得以存续，心中自然常怀感激，不过，共和党是时候该东山再起了。"
 USA_wfb_64_clarify_terms: "斟词酌句"
 USA_wfb_64_clarify_terms_desc: "迄今为止，我们通过的法案，再加上前几届政府制定的无数其他法规和法律，使得有关民权问题的立法变得混乱不堪。正是因为这种模糊的立法，才使种族隔离主义者和民权活动家都不知道他们的具体诉求到底有哪些。既然我们已经对任何进一步的立法放下了脚步，就应该把精力集中在澄清已经确立的法律上，确保所有的法律术语都有一个明确的定义，不存在“创造诠释”的空间。全体美国人都必须清楚地了解他们所生活的国家有哪些法律。"
 USA_wfb_64_sideline_republicans: "排挤民主党人"
 USA_wfb_64_sideline_republicans_desc: "据称，有些民主党盟友对政府的路线十分焦虑，颇感自己的自由派价值观被忽视了。我们应该稍稍提醒他们一下，上一届政府正因其赤裸裸的腐败和无能而被扫地出门，最终促成我们执政。他们心知肚明，人民不想再选择他们了，所以就应该靠边站，让我们好好领导美国。或许未来某一天，两党能重归一体，再现共和党-民主党联盟……"
 USA_wfb_64_through_guidance_stability: "稳定来自指导"
 USA_wfb_64_through_guidance_stability_desc: "本内特总统已经证明，共和党可以通过其冷静、保守的执政方式在国家政治中发挥主导作用。虽然也许很多人在诉求真正的进步，但为了所有人的利益，国家的稳定压倒一切。进步之火必须由传统的指导之手来控制，否则它会引燃我们的社会。对民权运动中的善人而言，我们知道你们不满足于此，但你们必须要耐住性子，因为我们的社会还没有完全准备好接纳你们的思想。你们的时代终将到来，但目前，我们必须在美国的征途中稳步向前。"
 USA_wfb_64_listen_to_stories: "洗耳恭听"
 USA_wfb_64_listen_to_stories_desc: "非裔美国人即为次等人的概念扎根于每个种族隔离主义者的心中，这样的现实不禁令人扼腕。虽然我们不太可能说动最固执的种族主义者，但是对于那些观点更温和的人来说，还是值得一试的。我们应该鼓励民权支持者讲出他们的经历、阐述种族隔离对他们产生的影响，尤其要让非裔美国人自己发声。通过让种族隔离主义者了解非裔美国人的近况，或许一些人会就此改变想法，并由此让我们获得推行改革必须的大众支持度。"

 USA_wfb_64_symbols_of_progress_desc: "我们已对民权运动做出了重大让步，并为让少数族裔社区参与进来付诸了努力。然而，我们的保守派选民开始发出不安的声音，他们感觉我们正开始疏远他们。我们已经做了很多好事，但如今是时候解决民权问题了。我们为造福人民所做的已经足够，如果我们现在停止，就可以避免让种族隔离主义者更加不安。"
 USA_wfb_64_fine_line: "如履薄冰"
 USA_wfb_64_fine_line_desc: "在自由主义和保守主义的理念之间，我们维持着一种谨慎地平衡。至少，这样的谨慎让我们同时得到了两党的默许。本内特总统信守诺言，他不遗余力地将整个美国团结到一面旗帜之下，从不偏袒任何一方，同时他又让每一方势力都能拿到好处，脱离困境。虽然没有任何一方的诉求会得到彻底满足，但这就是妥协的本质。我们的政府一直维持在一个合理的中间立场，在大多数情况下，美国政界极有可能维持现状。"
 USA_wfb_64_real_change: "真正的改革"
 USA_wfb_64_real_change_desc: "自1948年杜威当选以来，国会就一直在为民权法案不懈斗争，但无论是通过迪克西派和右翼共和党人组成的保守派联盟、不温不火的艾森豪威尔政府，还是犹豫不决的尼克松，结果却是一次又一次地被挫败。\n\n尽管对州权和联邦政府越权的担忧挥之不去，但本内特总统却改变了态度。在参议院多数党领袖林登·约翰逊与共民联盟内自由派人士的巨大压力下，美国第39任总统宣布，如果国会通过民权法案，他将签署该法案。"
 USA_wfb_64_empower_republicans: "授权民主党人"
 USA_wfb_64_empower_republicans_desc: "The strength of the Democrats in Congress has been a defining feature of American politics ever since the post-war backlash swept out a generation of Depression-era Republicans from office.\n\nTheir failure in the war devastated their party and plunged the nation into the political chaos that birthed the RDC and the NPP. But now the Democrats are supreme. No longer will conservative Republicans be able to stall America's progress. The emphasis of the RDC will now be on the D."
 USA_wfb_64_perfectly_broken: "完美且破碎的体制"
 USA_wfb_64_perfectly_broken_desc: "过去，总有人把民主党与共和党的联盟称作是一个嵌合体，保守主义和自由主义建制派政客一手创造出来的可憎怪物。毕竟，两个政见截然不同的政党怎能彼此合作呢？但本内特总统证明了，相比只坚持一党的政治理念，同时顾及到两党的价值观念对我们的国家其实更有益处。此外，虽然我们也是一个大帐篷，政见相当宽泛，但还是比争吵不休的NPP做得好多了。总而言之，本内特的总统任期使共和党和民主党彼此之间的联系更加紧密了；纵使我们经历过盛衰，但我们还是证明了共民联盟既可以顾及到所有人的利益，也可以团结一心，共同努力。"
 USA_wfb_64_through_fellowship_unity: "友谊带来团结"
 USA_wfb_64_through_fellowship_unity_desc: "只有一件事本内特总统没有妥协：那就是他愿意妥协。他尊重那些看重传统的人，与此同时，他从未怀疑过有意义的变革能得以实现，他确保我们社会的各方各面都得到了代言，证明了自己是真正的妥协大师。未来总会有更多的变革和变革的空间，但如果各方都相当满意，我们可以把这些讨论留给未来。种族隔离主义者、民权活动家、人民和政治家——我们都是美国人，现在我们可以走上前去，共同面对眼下的问题。"

 USA_wfb_64_sideline_democrats_desc: "林登·B·约翰逊是参议院元老。他在国会内待了三十多年，还在这个国家最大的审议机构当了近十年多数党领袖。约翰逊可是政治斗争的老手。\n\n虽然大坝和水利工程能收买西部地区选民、补贴和综合补助款能拉拢大平原人，但约翰逊清楚，在种族隔离事宜上，南方人的立场绝不会动摇。不论是政治分利，或是施压、贿赂，都不能让他们正眼看民权问题，就连约翰逊自己都不屑于理会。\n\n而他会让共和党也明白这一点。"
 USA_wfb_64_voting_rights_act: "选举权法案"
 USA_wfb_64_voting_rights_act_desc: "民主党人在参议院里的领袖林登·B·约翰逊，在党内多位著名人士的支持下发言，提出了一项选举权法案。这项法案在联邦层面承诺非裔美国人与其他少数族裔的政治权利与投票权，将会比我们迄今为止已实施的保护措施更进一步。随着进步价值观开始在共和党和民主党中胜出，反对这项能够巩固我们对民权运动的支持的新法案将毫无意义。然而，我们党内的许多人担心，此项举动将被隔离主义者视为严重的违法行为，我们很可能会因此失去南方的大量支持。"
 USA_wfb_64_through_change_progress: "变革带来进步"
 USA_wfb_64_through_change_progress_desc: "我们是保守主义者，这一点自然不会改变。但在一个国家如此需要倾听和吸取其他意见的时候，如果我们不去听取，那就称不上保守，而应该算顽固了。我们传统的选民可能不会满意，但代表全体美国人民是我们的责任，而不仅仅是那些在投票站打勾的人。我们必须保障民众那些真正不可剥夺的权利，如此才能让国家团结为一体。至于那些种族隔离主义者；可能就要失望了，但你们也要知道，在其他方面我们仍将代表你们的意志。季节更替，时代也在变化。为了我们国家的利益，美国必须改变。"

 WFB.72.desc: "对世界上大部分平头百姓而言，OFN就是一个由美国领导的军事同盟，旨在一同反制其敌人。\n\n而坐在新罕布什尔州那间房间里的人则再清楚不过这点了。本内特认为，开场适合先谈谈一个大家都熟悉的议题：军事整合法案。\n\n法案条款无外乎物资保障方面的细节：为开展联合军事行动，全OFN都将采用统一的制式步枪、弹药和卡车。这是军事同盟的例行措施，但自由国家一如既往做得比法西斯好。不同于团结协定和共荣圈行驶方法的地方在于，法案也规定美国需要大幅增加军工开支。自由世界的领头人将为每一个成员国买单，这样既能让所有国家都能改用新的物资规格，又不至于为此散尽家财。\n\n不出意外，众人对此颇有疑虑。大多数成员国都有自己的军工产业，谈到让美国规定决定统一标准的时候有顾虑是可以理解的。\n\n不过，有一个国家的代表立刻表示同意——澳大利亚。位于太平洋之中的他们孑然一身，正面对抗高度工业化的日本。澳大利亚人再清楚不过这一法案能带来的好处了。\n\n澳洲总理对此十分热切，他与其的内阁已开始着手推进法案实施，其他一些与会者对此点头表示认可。本内特总统看在眼里，乐在心里。"

 WFB.77.t: "IMF - 否决！"
 WFB.77.desc: "虽然美国和加拿大代表都赞成这项提案，但房间里的其他人却不太愿意接受。\n\n这些政客担心的是他们的选民，以及对选民造成不利影响，他们可能更加害怕那些不愿加入OFN的人得势。可以理解，其它国家对接受一项政策为何会如此犹豫不决。他们担心这项政策带来的不利影响，其实这项政策对贫穷和需要帮助的国家造成了损害，而非援助。还有些人认为，即使他们可以尝试换个说法，这项政策看上去也还是太像一种剥削手段了。\n\n最难过还的是本内特和罗伯逊。罗伯逊垂头丧气地坐在椅子上。过了一会儿，他闷闷不乐地转过身，让助手给他递了一杯浓咖啡。\n\n本内特对国际货币基金组织的瓦解表示哀悼。他可以理解为什么人们会反对它，为什么OFN国家们如此犹豫不决。但他觉得OFN错过了互帮互助的机会。毕竟，朋友之间就应该这样。"

Men who he'd otherwise have very little in common. Bennett's rejection of the Trade Expansion Act introduced in the house symbolized, depending on who you asked, the Administration's dangerous isolationist leanings, its hidebound conservative tendencies, or proof of its association with corrupt unions.\n\nBennett checked his watch, resisting coffee's temptation before his 6 o'clock meeting, lest further rumour of that leak out to Utah. Oh sure, Robertson and Fowler had tried their damndest to sway to their views.

 WFB.106.t: "在迪克西的土地上……"
 WFB.106.desc: "今天，为了敲定一份双方均可接受的民权法案，共民联盟与迪克西派（大多是NPP）的领袖在南卡罗来纳州的哥伦比亚会面——这场会面现在被称为哥伦比亚会议。与会者包括华莱士·F·本内特总统、林登·B·约翰逊参议员、斯特罗姆·瑟蒙德参议员。这对于许多人来说是个好消息，因为它预示着出台民权立法——不论其形式为何——的希望。但也不乏有人感到恐慌，他们害怕迪克西派借着民权法案阻碍任何真正的变革。\n\n南卡罗来纳的州议会大厦前，本内特总统与斯特罗姆·瑟蒙德参议员被许多政客、记者与保镖簇拥着，他们在众人的见证之下握手。两位领袖与他们各自的党派似乎乐意于达成协议，但只有时间才能证明一切。"
 WFB.106.a: "……我会表明我的态度"
 WFB.107.t: "完美的妥协"
 WFB.107.desc: "今天，在一项声明中，斯特罗姆·瑟蒙德与本内特总统达成了一项友好协议，迪克西派对共民联盟和他们的民权法案做出了巨大让步，这对全国数百万人来说是无疑是一个惊喜。本内特总统对记者说道，“这是民主和美国人民美好的一天。我很高兴与瑟蒙德参议员和他的选民集团达成了一项良好的协议。”\n\n在未来几周，修改后的民权法案预计将在没有太多问题的情况下迅速通过国会两院。一些更强硬的迪克西派对意想不到的让步感到愤怒，但总的来说，两党都兴高采烈地结束了哥伦比亚会议。"
 WFB.107.a: "出人意料，但令人欢欣雀舞。"
 WFB.108.t: "适当的妥协"
 WFB.108.desc: "今天，在一个不出意料的转折中，斯特罗姆·瑟蒙德和本内特总统达成了一项粗略、勉强的协议，迪克西派只愿意对共民联盟及其民权法案做出微小的让步。在哥伦比亚会议上，超过一半的迪克西派干脆退场，拒绝让步。本内特总统对记者说道，“这是民主和美国人民美好的一天。我很高兴达成了协议，得以推进这项法案。”\n\n令许多人沮丧的是，新的民权法案比以前保守得多。共民联盟做出了一些牺牲，却只获得了少数南方人微不足道的支持。在未来几周，经过大幅修改的法案预计将在国会勉强通过，票数刚好足够。总的来说，新法案证明了一个美国的分裂问题，两党对此都有些不满。"
 WFB.108.a: "进一步，退两步"
 WFB.109.t: "哥伦比亚会议失败！"
 WFB.109.desc: "哥伦比亚传来的消息如同阴云笼罩了全国，美国的未来一片渺茫。哥伦比亚会议失败了。过去一周，来自全国各地的政治家在南卡罗来纳州议会大厦就本内特总统民权法案的妥协进行了辩论。很不幸，迪克西派无法与共民联盟和总统达成协议，因此，该法案没有得到修正，也不太可能获得通过立法所需要的票数。\n\n本内特总统在离开哥伦比亚会议时说，他对未能达成协议感到失望，但他相信无论如何该法案都会通过。\n\n哥伦比亚会议的失败震惊了一些人，对另一些人来说是不幸但又不可避免的结果。本内特总统的民权法案未来会如何，民众不得而知，恐怕美国的未来也同样飘忽不定。"
 WFB.109.a: "本内特现在该怎么办？"
 WFB.110.t: "迪克西派拒绝妥协！"
 WFB.110.desc: "本内特总统在华盛顿特区发表演讲，要求公开会见迪克西派领导人，争取双方达成妥协。许多人预计迪克西派至少会表现出合作的意愿。但事实很不幸，他们的顽固本性丝毫没有改变，斯特罗姆·瑟蒙德在他的投票决策会议的坚定支持下，明确宣布拒绝会见总统。“我们不会支持民权，”瑟蒙德参议员如此说道，“今天不行，明天不行，再过一个世纪也不行。”\n\n全国上下再次屏住呼吸，在即将对该法案进行的投票中，双方的分裂难以置信。本内特总统尚未对事态发展发表任何评论。总统看上去似乎胜券在握，而没有选择斥责迪克西派来制造更紧张的局势。"
 WFB.110.a: "但愿没了他们的投票，法案也能通过。"
 WFB.111.t: "新盟友"
 WFB.111.desc: "由于迪克西派拒绝合作，本内特总统被迫寻找他法，尝试通过民权法案。目前，总统和他的共民联盟盟友正在NPP左派和进步派国会议员中寻找盟友。此外，共民联盟中一些犹豫不决的民主党人可能是本内特新投票集团的候选人。今天，本内特总统和参议员林登·约翰逊正在会见NPP的几名党员，最著名的是进步派的[GetRFKOrJackson]，总统正在争取他们对民权法案的支持。然而，到目前为止，这些联盟才刚刚开始形成，他们是否真的能够通过该法案还有待观察。随着国会对民权法案的投票日越来越近，人们不禁要问，总统是否真的可以及时组建政治联盟。"
 WFB.111.a: "谁说我们还需要迪克西派的帮助？"
 WFB.112.t: "联盟化为灰烬"
 WFB.112.desc: "在会见了几位有影响力的NPP国会议员以及一些民主党人后，本内特总统和他支持民权的决策会议空手而归。尽管这在意料之中，但考虑到这些联盟的仓促性质，这对总统来说仍然是一个挫折。由于他的法案没有潜在的新支持者，本内特陷入了尴尬的境地；他必须提出一项他明知道一定会被否决的法案。\n\n本内特总统尚未对这些失败的妥协和联盟发表评论，他只是回应说，“我们会让法案通过的，还请大家不要担心。”"
 WFB.112.a: "他现在还会吗？"
 WFB.113.t: "老地方，新朋友"
 WFB.113.desc: "一切都完成了：联盟已经建立。经过一些辩论和审议，进步派和共民联盟的大多数骑墙派都已经加入了本内特总统民权法案的投票党团。假设一切按计划进行，该法案应该能够在众议院和参议院都获得通过。\n\n有些令人惊讶的是，说服进步派的一些左倾的进步派投票支持该法案并不简单。党内有影响力的人物，如迈克尔·哈灵顿，发现这项民权法案没有实现真正的社会平等。同时，他还认为，如果该法案获得通过，就不会有进一步民权立法的政治意愿。与此相反，许多保守的民主党人担心该法案可能过于激进。事实证明，平衡这两个群体是一个巨大的挑战；但没有他们的支持，这项法案是不会通过的。尽管遇到了一些挫折，总统和参议员林登·约翰逊还是说服了他们投票通过该项法案。\n\n这个政治联盟没有任何的官方通告，可能永远也不会有。然而，关于忠诚改变的消息传播得很快，政治上的内幕总是很容易泄露。毫无疑问，斯特罗姆·瑟蒙德和他的迪克西派们已经知道本内特赌赢了，他们一定会感到恐惧吧。"
 WFB.113.a: "与瑟蒙德的合作就这样结束了……"
 WFB.114.t: "全面的民权立法通过了！"
 WFB.114.desc: "今天，在一项令人惊讶的声明中，本内特总统的自由主义民权法案获得通过，这可能是自1870年宪法第十五条修正案通过以来对非白人最重要的法律保护。它包括对投票权的全面保护，强行禁止各州针对非裔美国人的“识字测试”。同时，这项立法还包括了彻底废除美国社会种族隔离的时间表，要求在四个月内废除所有吉姆·克劳法和其他基于种族的立法。然而，最重要的是，它禁止基于种族、肤色、宗教或民族血统的就业歧视。\n\n令许多人感到惊讶的是，这样一个包罗万象的自由民权法案竟然一开始就被通过了。在该法案投票前的几周，本内特总统和他的盟友们在共民联盟内部努力争取了不少选票。最终，总统似乎通过了这项法案，而且在对少数民族的权利和自由上没有丝毫的妥协。"
 WFB.114.a: "令人惊叹。"
 WFB.115.t: "温和的民权法案通过了！"
 WFB.115.desc: "今天，本内特总统的民权法案在众议院和参议院获得了多数票，总统很快将签署该法案，使之成为实质性的立法。该法案虽然不如一些人希望的那样全面，但仍是自1870年宪法第十五条修正案通过以来美国人之间实现完全平等的最大一步。该法案包括联邦对投票权的保护，禁止“识字测试”和州一级旨在剥夺少数民族投票权的其他此类欺诈措施，同时还包括禁止基于种族、肤色或者宗教的就业歧视。\n\n然而，许多更倾向自由派的公民对该法案的结果感到不满。该法案最初更加自由和全面，对少数民族权利的保护要大得多。由于需要与华盛顿的保守派政治家妥协，其中几项保护条例被放宽或干脆完全取消。尽管如此，全国大多数人只是对任何民权立法的通过感到高兴。"
 WFB.115.a: "不似希望中的那样好，但还不错。"
 WFB.116.t: "保守的民权法案通过了！"
 WFB.116.desc: "经过几个月的审议、妥协和投票，本内特总统的民权法案终于在国会两院获得通过，并可能在未来几周签署成为法律。曾经高度自由的民权法案现在已经被华盛顿的保守分子大幅修改过了。所有关于保护少数民族不被剥夺选举权的投票规定都已取消，仅适度禁止就业上的歧视性。此外，该法案还增加了广泛的例外情况，规定在某些情况下，不必强制执行对少数群体的保护。\n\n总的来说，该法案招致了华盛顿更自由派政治家的大量批评，许多人认为它根本没有效果。虽然全国各地的保守派对这个结果感到满意，但本内特的民权立法很快就不再受到公众的欢迎。"
 WFB.116.a: "令人失望，但并不意外。"
 WFB.117.t: "满意的迪克西派"
 WFB.117.desc: "一项出人意料的保守民权法案不久前在本内特总统的推动下得以通过，迪克西派对此表露出的欣喜之情倒是不足为奇。南卡罗来纳州参议员、狂热的民权反对者斯特罗姆·瑟蒙德最近发表了一次电视讲话，向那些“在国会中占据多数的清醒人士”表达了“感谢”。\n\n然而，总的来说，总统与共民联盟的处境着实被动。迪克西派的公开支持意味着民权法案对于公众而言显得名不副实，从中还能看出本内特似乎不太注重民意，更多地是为了得到他自己想要的东西而行事。\n\n近期的一次新闻发布会上，当被问及事态的转变以及他的政府是否正趋向保守时，总统说道：\n\n“我仍然是宣誓就职时的那个本内特。我向来坚守本心，未曾改变过自己的观点。南方投票党团对我的行为感到满意，并不是因为我转而成为他们的代言人；相反，这只是我们所达成的某些协议的结果——我向你保证，这些协议一直存在。”"
 WFB.117.a: "一些人的快乐，建立在他人的痛苦上。"
 WFB.118.t: "自由派变得更加谨慎"
 WFB.118.desc: "最近几周，在美国总统本内特通过了一项惊人的保守民权法案后，民主党和一些NPP为代表的国会自由派发现自己处于一个尴尬的境地。在他们的家乡，许多选民认可他们的自由主义理念。现在，这些选民对他们接受和支持这样一项保守的立法感到非常不满。因此，如果未来继续采取更加保守的行动，自由派们就将面临连任失败的严重威胁。\n\n可以理解，许多自由派国会议员害怕可能会被他人取代。作为回应，他们已经开始团结起来，在立法方面发挥更大的作用。此外，他们对本内特总统威胁共民联盟的团结感到非常不安。如果他们面临投票支持另一项保守的法案，他们就不大可能再支持总统了，而是会尽一切努力阻止该法案的通过。"
 WFB.118.a: "不妙。"
 WFB.119.t: "投票调查一无所获"
 WFB.119.desc: "联邦政府对深南方地区涉嫌歧视性投票做法的调查一无所获。尽管存在“识字测试”和“投票税”阻止少数族裔投票这样的指控，但与之形成鲜明对比的是，联邦调查局和其他调查机构确定，这些说法完全属于空穴来风，实际上并不存在发生违反宪法第十五条修正案的情况。\n\n这些调查已经招致了全国自由派和进步分子的大规模批评。这些组织声称这些调查就是在欺诈、里面充斥着腐败和调查不全面、不充分的情况。然而，就联邦政府而言，这些说法没有什么根据，废止州级投票规定的立法不太可能通过。"
 WFB.119.a: "难道调查员出了什么问题？"
 WFB.120.t: "进步人士感到不安"
 WFB.120.desc: "联邦政府最近对深南方地区剥夺投票权的调查空手而归后，在全国各地的进步分子掀起了轩然大波。进步主义者称调查就是欺诈与腐败，里面充斥着偏激。调查结束仅几周后，马克思党团和进步党团就要求引入新的调查人员，重新调查。\n\n进步党团的政治领袖迈克尔·哈灵顿称南方的投票过程是“卑鄙、歧视性和不民主”，并要求启动新的联邦调查。本内特总统和共和党-民主党联盟大部分成员驳回了所有腐败或其他操纵选票的指控，但也没有制定新的调查计划。"
 WFB.120.a: "冷静点，迈克。"
 WFB.121.t: "致美国同胞"
 WFB.121.desc: "“我亲爱的美国同胞们，我们国家最鲜明的特征，或许就是你我之间的兄弟情谊，没有什么比兄弟情谊更加强大。我们接受同胞的缺点，承认我们作为一个的单一民族团结起来。然而，在最近对我们南方兄弟的做法进行调查后，我们并没有发现任何缺点。尽管如此，许多人仍然认为我们的南方兄弟是骗子；他们贪污腐败，他们糊弄了我们的政府。”\n\n“正是这样的指控撕裂了我们的国家。它们撕裂了我们民族博爱的核心，削弱了我们团结的集体。如果我们伟大的土地要追随她无止境的进步，那这些虚假的指控必须首先被克服。在没有明确证据的情况下，我们必须信任我们的兄弟，就像信任我们最亲密的亲人一样。”\n\n本内特总统从讲稿中抬起头来对着镜头。“我亲爱的美国同胞，我请求你们：信任你们的兄弟，就像我信任你们一样。”"
 WFB.121.a: "保持冷静，坚持妥协。"
 WFB.122.t: "进步派妥协！"
 WFB.122.desc: "过去几周，在本内特总统发表兄弟情谊演讲后，国家进步公约左派和国会里的其他进步人士对保守的民权法案采取了更积极的立场。今天，参议员[GetRFKOrJackson]在白宫会见了本内特，准备接受国家政策的右倾。民主党领袖、参议员林登·贝恩斯·约翰逊也发来了措辞温和的赞成意见，他说民主党将继续与共和党在一个联盟中合作。总的来说，这对未来的法案投票产生了积极的影响，本内特和共民联盟在追求民权方面的情况正在好转。\n\n许多第三方观察家都出乎意料。总统的讲话虽然措辞巧妙，但丝毫没有缓和国会里的进步人士对民权法案的抱怨和恐惧。这可能暗示肯尼迪和他的投票集团并没有想象中的那么团结。无论如何，他们现在支持这一版民权法案。现在要做的只剩下投票了：投票将决定美国的未来。"
 WFB.122.a: "好极了。"
 WFB.123.t: "进步派拒绝妥协！"
 WFB.123.desc: "过去几周，在本内特总统发表兄弟情谊演讲后，许多人预计国会里的进步人士会选择妥协，转而支持总统保守的民权法案。然而，左派们拒绝在民权问题上让步，不同意和共和党与国家进步公约右翼一同投票支持民权法案。总统继续呼吁进步人士“坚持民族兄弟情谊”，“走一条所有美国人都能接受的道路”。\n\nNPP社会民主派的领袖，参议员[GetRFKOrJackson]说他的立场非常坚定。几乎所有的进步派都不再接受本内特的“团结”呼吁。参议员林登·贝恩斯·约翰逊可以说是国会中最有影响力的民主党人，他亦选择追随肯尼迪，声称该法案“与共和党-民主党联盟的根基背道而驰”。许多进步人士团结在肯尼迪和约翰逊身后，认为该法案只会削弱公众对民权立法的支持，同时在实际种族平等方面也几乎起不到什么作用。如果没有他们的帮助，共民联盟可能会被迫重新起草民权法案，制定一部对进步人士更加友好的法案。"
 WFB.123.a: "去你妈的，肯尼迪！"
 WFB.124.t: "顺我者昌，逆我者亡"
 WFB.124.desc: "自从[GetRFKOrJackson]和他的NPP决策集团决定不再支持本内特总统的保守民权法案以来，共民联盟就想尽了办法网罗选票。共民联盟的参议院和众议院党鞭一直在夜以继日地工作，恐吓、贿赂等手段无所不用其极，为的就是胁迫骑墙派给本内特的民权法案投票。到目前为止，赞成与反对者势均力敌，似乎当投票日到来时，少数的几名国会议员将决定该法案的未来。\n\n如果共民联盟未能获得足够的支持，他们可能会被迫取消投票，并重新起草更加左倾的法案。一旦发生这种情况，共民联盟大概就会陷入第22条军规的困境中，无法摆脱进退两难的局面；如果他们试着修改法案，使其更加偏向自由主义，他们就将失去保守派的支持，但如果他们不修改法案，他们又会失去进步派的支持。"
 WFB.124.a: "谁还需要NPP？"
 WFB.125.t: "重新起草法案"
 WFB.125.desc: "本内特总统的民权法案距离众议院投票只有几天了，共民联盟突然取消了投票。这一消息是参议员[GetRFKOrJackson]在华盛顿会见总统后不到一周后宣布的，[GetRFKOrJackson]是进步派NPP的领袖，也是该法案的反对者。虽然会议记录没有公布，但很可能是为了讨论对民权法案可能得到的支持。\n\n支持该法案的保守派已经怀疑他们与共民联盟达成的妥协似乎要告吹了，总统已经转而支持进步人士。保守派们开始逐步撤回支持。总统似乎陷入了困境，如果没有两个团体的支持，他就不能通过法案，但如果与某个党派妥协，他就将失去另一个党派的支持。\n\n在未来几周，该法案可能会以一种进步得多的方式重新起草。只有时间才能证明这份新草案是否会取得成功。"
 WFB.125.a: "重新规划"
 WFB.126.t: "迪克西派……又开始抱怨了"
 WFB.126.desc: "在他们最近的一次大发脾气中，迪克西派现在抱怨说，本内特总统自由得出人意料的民权法案侵犯了“州权”。他们尤其抱怨该法案的核心条款之一：各州不得执行用以决定选民投票资格的测试。这一条款专门针对南部各州，这些州执行的“识字”测试几乎不可能让非裔美国人通过，从而剥夺了他们的投票权。\n\n显然，这些州资助的测试违反了第十五条修正案，因此根据联邦法律是非法的。尽管如此，斯特罗姆·瑟蒙德领导下的迪克西派认为这些测试是公平、简单和非歧视性的。这些测试现在是非法的，但是迪克西派会牢骚、抱怨，直到历史的车轮碾过他们。"

 WFB.154.t: "本内特与保守派并肩前行！"
 WFB.154.desc: "令许多人惊讶的是，本内特总统在民权问题上站在共民联盟的保守派一边，打破了国会共和党与民主党之间不稳定的平衡，并将国家推向了坚定支持种族隔离的方向。不少民权运动的组织因此沮丧不已。这一决定的影响将在未来几年里显现，无论是在政策上还是日渐不稳的执政联盟上。\n\n到目前为止，共和党与南方民主党人在民权辩论中基本持保守立场，反对禁止基于种族歧视的条款。他们在国会新获得的主导地位将有利于种族隔离州的现状，让投票权和其他激烈争辩的话题由他们自行决定。但这将如何影响以前的民权立法尚不确定。\n\n联盟中自由派和保守派之间不稳定的联盟现在日渐不稳，许多民主党人和自由派共和党人很快谴责了共民联盟内的当权派。在这些分歧之后，NPP也可能会得到这些自由派政治家的支持。不管怎样，南方的种族隔离制度似乎已然新生。"

 USA_WFB_CFN_reform_4_tt: "§W固定汇率§!\n\n§F是否将OFN各国货币的币值与美元直接挂钩一直是个极具争议的问题，其支持者与对OFN目前货币体系不满的反对者各执一词，互不相让。这一方案的具体措施是借助OFN各个国家的央行共同协调阵营内货币的总体平衡，由于本内特总统稳定美元币值的举措，这一方案正在获得越来越多的支持。如果OFN内部各国的货币能与币值稳定的美元直接挂钩，那么整个组织的经济系统就将会相当稳定，还能防止各个国家的货币币值出现大幅度波动。\n\n当然，各国货币的币值并不总是与美元直接相关。因此，整个OFN的货币体系将会在预估系统的指导下，在现有的银行体系中稳定运行。我们会制定汇率波动的上限和下限，使得各国之间的外贸价格处于其可接受的范围内，但愿如此。§!"

 POLITICS_GLD_DESC: "“一位基督徒、一位犹太人、一位飞行员和一位参议员，走进了华盛顿的酒吧。‘好，那么戈德华特先生，我能为您招待些什么呢？’侍者问道。”巴里·莫里斯·戈德华特所讲的这个关于自己的笑话，深切反映出这位主宰共民联盟西部与南部各支部的男人的复杂履历。戈德华特出生在亚利桑那州，父亲是犹太人，与身为美国圣公会教徒的母亲两人共同经营着一家百货商店。年轻的戈德华特生活平白无奇，直至第二次世界大战爆发后，他选择加入美国陆军航空兵，成为一名预备役军官，也是隶属运输指挥部的飞行员。\n\n在他持续不断地将物资从后方转移到亚欧大陆各前线的过程中，戈德华特接触过许多人，因此对法西斯主义深恶痛疾，对杜威政府失败的和平政策，也同样如此。战争结束后，戈德华特咄咄逼人的论调，与毫不掩饰的社会保守主义主张，帮助他顺利取代了退休离任的民主党人麦克法兰，在1953年出任亚利桑那州参议员。\n\n不久后，戈德华特开始崛起为共民联盟中共和党的领袖之一，他拒绝民主党招揽，只因为他个人对艾森豪威尔的厌恶，也拒绝NPP的招揽，因为他认为他们对日本过于念念不忘，何况还是社会主义激进分子的巢穴。不久后，他就凭借自身魅力与内在激情，登临总统宝座。\n\n狂风骇浪般的支持率，将他送进白宫，全世界都对大洋彼岸报以希望与顾虑的目光，美国正在充分重整军备，在对抗世界法西斯敌人的道路上，迈进了一大步。"

 USA_gld_68_conservative_cabinet_desc: "这次选举证明，美国已经准备好改变过去二十年来的充满混乱的自由主义的路线。与其在做出决定时冒着混乱和拖延的风险，向共民联盟内所有派别献媚。不如任命一个坚定的保守派内阁，以确保戈德华特的政策得到落实。我们不会被那些只会夸夸其谈与妥协的人牵着鼻子走！"

 USA_gld_68_financial_reform: "金融改革"
 USA_gld_68_financial_reform_desc: "戈德华特可谓是现任美国政府中最狂热的保守派之一，他会粗暴无情地推动自己的信念。如果他的党派想在他推动小政府保守主义的目标上妥协，自然也包括与党内诸如纳尔逊·洛克菲勒之类的自由派产生冲突的情形，这时他会毫不犹豫地将他们一脚踢开。戈德华特会推广他的理念，包括税率扁平化、系统性取消林登·约翰逊式的财政补贴（在农业上尤为关键）、敲打要价太高的工会（特别是要求重审瓦格纳法案等一系列法案）、恢复工会成员自愿加入的规则、将商业和贸易的职责重新委托给各州，以及重新审阅国会通过的所有金融法律，断然无视宪法第十修正案对其行为作出的禁令。"

 USA_gld_68_go_with_regan: "追随里甘"
 USA_gld_68_go_with_regan_desc: "Rebuking the moderates thins the line between Goldwaterian economics and a better cohered market for America. However, with Don Regan at the reigns of the treasury, it's now imperative to remain on the same page with him and tug him along in the right direction. He has a tendency to romanticize supply side policy without clearly following its actual stated objectives if political expediency presents itself more attractively. Optimistically, referring him back to his boss' unwavering, literalist fealty for the Constitution will make him think twice if needed. It will all be easy enough if you can follow the 10th Amendment, kill monopolies, cut government, and emancipate the American economy from the welfare state. Keep the market free, and keep it healthy."
 USA_gld_68_tone_it_down: "调子低点"
 USA_gld_68_tone_it_down_desc: "Statism cannot be cut down in a day, and the Democrats are not all bad; the balance between left and right is what keeps the country afloat and Goldwater knows it. This, of course, means setting Don Regan aside and keeping the incumbent Treasury Secretary in his appointed position. As his dear friend Buckley might advise, if they can simply be persuaded to explore the options with a Goldwater presidency and market, it will be easier to extricate them from thinking government is the soothing balm for all social wounds. Goldwater will make his cuts into welfareism and state apparatuses more gradual in exchange for an easier time pushing his objectives through an already divided Congress. In due time, the reigns will be secure, and America set right."
 USA_gld_68_out_of_depression: "走出萧条"
 USA_gld_68_out_of_depression_desc: "Our economy cannot and will not recuperate from the Depression without letting it sort itself into order before applying any government bandaids. To Goldwater, a significant reason for perdurable American economic success in the 19th century was the wisdom against adversely impacting the market with artificial government competition; deviating from which is certainly what wrought the cancer that is corporate monopoly upon the world, and shifty union men along with it. Open competition, free trade, and resisting the urge to make the government's teat a congregation of suckling infants who'll take generations to recover their prosperity, even more so their independency thereby will bear their laborious fruits in due time. The object is a process which respects the rule of law, for which Goldwater has all the patience in this world."
 USA_gld_68_sound_fiscal_economy: "稳健的财政经济"
 USA_gld_68_sound_fiscal_economy_desc: "Sound and fiscal means, quite frankly no more promiscuous dalliances with experimental social aid, not a bit more of the old, fruitless rigmarole of pumping money into the states until they comply with Federal standards, and not a whisper of mention for subsidizing failure with people's hard earned tax dollars. Industry will be stimulated by more unrestrained trade with America's remaining allies with emphasis placed on hard cash getters like American coal and plant grains for exports, and European luxury goods (in limited quantities), minerals, oil, and dispensable commodities for imports. Broad markets and narrow Federal waste will lead the American economy to stable triumph."
 USA_gld_68_program_evaluation: "项目评估"
 USA_gld_68_program_evaluation_desc: "The more useless programs, the more the government spends on gratuitous, self-expanding ventures that harm and hamper more than they help. The market becomes plainly impotent when the government subsidizes failure or bails out economic decrepitude, anchoring it to the measly pittances the Federal bodies are actually capable of throwing at the problem. More programs mean more tax money thrown in directions that people could have used to make it out better on their own and of course ever higher taxes to exact the funds needed to support such a bloated apparatus. As such, it's time to cleave welfare and benefits of the like that are better provided by the people most directly involved. From corporate headquarters to country farms, it's high time to bean crippling dependency on government money in the head."
 USA_gld_68_reduce_agriculture_subsidies: "削减农业补贴"
 USA_gld_68_reduce_agriculture_subsidies_desc: "Farms are an irreplaceable component of American infrastructure, but what good are they if they are forced to wastefully produce more than they can realistically distribute? Goldwater submits the only thing worse than the explicit endorsement of perishable excesses, is the implicit funding of non-production to maintain an imaginary placeholder. And since when did the 10th Amendment sanction this sort of foolish meddling in agriculture to begin with? Let the chips fall where they may, let farms and farmers live up to their proper potentials, and good riddance to these cumbersome subsidies, suffocating price supports, and counterintuitive production controls. If farmers cannot cultivate our land without the Federal government mucking up the works, the country will never get around to making a living off of it."
 USA_gld_68_cut_wasteful_welfare: "裁减福利浪费"
 USA_gld_68_cut_wasteful_welfare_desc: "Within the Goldwater approach, what he and other fiscal rightists call \"welfareism\" is the scourge of a healthy state, market, and nation. If it suspends the 10th Amendment for any excuse whatsoever in order to permit a government imposition on the country's economy, it is an inherent outgrowth of this affliction. The larger body of Federal aid, social programs, and stimulus pick-me-ups comprise the spiteful organism that primarily embodies said \"welfareism\". It stunts the people and businesses by making the government a strident economic competitor in the market which drives competition off the rails rather than the government searching for non-competitive foul play as like its delegated responsibilities from the trustbusting 1910's. It worsens the government by giving it a part it does not know how to play with the competency instilled from the consequences of being a private body who must suffer the results it reaps from both successful and failed operations. It becomes the proverbial bull in the China shop, while somehow acquiring proprietary rights to the entire China shop. Anti-welfare propositions intend to consign that chaos to yesterday."
 USA_gld_68_balanced_budget: "平衡预算"
 USA_gld_68_balanced_budget_desc: "With Congressional spending on the path to an equilibrium status, that equilibrium itself will need to be secured. The measures needed to accomplish that lie in pruning yet more spending outgrowths, redundant government offices, even whole departments that are, in accordance with the 10th Amendment as well as a groaning Federal pocketbook, foundationally gratuitous. No more will the Keynesian doctrine of self-debt be permitted to crawl along the floorboards of the Capitol and White House, debts will be addressed by unfailingly consistent payment plans where possible or go un-incurred in the first place. If the government can't pay it, loans should become a last resort rather than a convenient stepping stone to gratifying the social magicianship of big-headed policy men. If it involves profligately overarching regulation, it should be examined to see how it can be cut down rather than gymnastically complicated into being \"workable\". The budget should not be a wishlist for fanciful politicians, but rather a well-oiled machine to keep the country running, and that requires a compact unit that meets bare civic necessities instead of drooling over wasteful stimulus packages."
 USA_gld_68_cap_the_debt_ceiling: "设定债务上限"
 USA_gld_68_cap_the_debt_ceiling_desc: "Inordinate, reckless expenditure has become Congress' default resolution for various national crises. The administration's fiscal conservatism demands this halts immediately so the government can apportion tax dollars more judiciously; as well as explore other solutions to social and infrastructural maladies than vomiting Federal coffers dry into them. To prevent extremity from outdoing itself, Goldwater and company are pushing a cap to the debt ceiling. However, Goldwater knows from his Senate days that this manner of push may be fatally tainted from its outset. Knowing this, his cabinet is hiding a card deck of various spending stopgaps off the table to enter play in the event that the debt ceiling is allowed to fizz out of the bottle. The extraneous buck stops here."
 USA_gld_68_the_working_men_should_work: "劳动者应该工作"
 USA_gld_68_the_working_men_should_work_desc: "Next year's budget proposals have caused an uproar, as spending on welfare programs like employment insurance and Social Security have been massively cut back, along with a whole series of other programs that conservatives have long claimed only incentivises laziness and freeloading off the government. In a White House Press Conference, President Goldwater himself has stood up for his proposals, saying that these programs have been given too freely in the past to \"... those that can, and should be working, but choose not to because they think the government can provide for them.\" But it's the last line that dominates headlines: \"Working men should work!\""
 USA_gld_68_kill_the_tariffs: "消灭关税"
 USA_gld_68_kill_the_tariffs_desc: "Goldwater has always been a believer that America can, and always will, build anything better than anyone else. However, that can lead to situations where American made products are expensive and out of reach of millions of poorer Americans. Regan has proposed that maybe tariffs should be cut on imported goods from other countries, to allow cheaper products from overseas to provide for these markets that American companies aren't providing for. Plus, since the US isn't spending as much money on welfare anymore, we don't need to collect as much money as before. So why not make the accountants jobs at the Treasury Department a little bit easier?"
 USA_gld_68_skin_the_budget: "缓增预算"
 USA_gld_68_skin_the_budget_desc: "The budget is still hinderingly bloated, and Goldwater figures it is high time to simply skin its blubbery carcass alive. Patience with its engorged stature has only led to failure in the limited four year stints of other chief executives, and Goldwater refuses to be another complacent zookeeper that feeds into its bulk. The administration will begin an effective immediate lobby push for reduced social programs, moderate prohibitions on Federal loan taking, slashing a chunk from commerce regulations, particularly as levied at farmers, small businesses, and interstate merchants. Special, pricey, and cronyist protections for unions and massive companies: out. More money for defense, civil services, and necessary infrastructure: in. Cut the fat and produce a smaller budget in proportion to the realistically smaller legitimate duties of the Federal government."
 USA_gld_68_conservative_finance: "保守的财政"
 USA_gld_68_conservative_finance_desc: "Government spending is forecasted to be well down from previous years, which makes future tax cuts that much more enticing. With the lazy bums forced to find jobs since their monthly free money has vanished, there are now millions more people looking for work. So what if the bleeding heart liberals are crying at us for pushing poverty levels up? It's only because they aren't working hard enough. With an expanded workforce crying for jobs, we can now encourage companies to invest and build in America, making all the stuff our nation will ever need. They don't need to build their branch plants or invest overseas. We already have the largest single market in the world. America First!"
 USA_gld_68_austerity_in_finance_abundance_in_defense: "财政紧缩，国防扩张"
 USA_gld_68_austerity_in_finance_abundance_in_defense_desc: "War brings arduous necessities, among these is acknowledging when to cut back other public expenses in order to serve the country's ability to wage the wars needed to protect it. The American war machine hasn't thoroughly greased its joints in what seems like ages, and little eases friction in them quite like money for war machines and a place to send them. Needless to say, this entails a comprehensive austerity to reserve the funds for purchasing equipment, arms, and such; not to mention the scrap materials to manufacture them. Public allotments for social programs, subsidies, and commerce enforcements evaporate from their original applications and resurface back in the Defense Department's coffers via executive order and urgently phrased, persuasive communiques to Congress. The skin is pulled tight to Uncle Sam's face and he's letting the excess come out in munitions and engines to drive them to their scheduled destination."
 USA_gld_68_rumsfield's_plan: "拉姆斯菲尔德的计划"
 USA_gld_68_rumsfield's_plan_desc: "A vaguely technocratic ideal of the military, Donald Rumsfeld's program is one for endorsing hardware over manpower, while paring down, refining, and reapplying the select droves of men we already have enlisted (usually in more sparing placements and field assaults, but on what are deemed to be more strategic contact points). Rumsfeld specifically has an interest in higher technology, aeronautic war-making, including using satellites more robustly, developing sleeker spy planes with better photographic powers, and honing airstrikes into a precise art form which devastate pressure points rather than merely carpet bombing South Africa into whatever predated the Stone Age. Goldwater in his air force background finds this appealing if a tad wishy-washy in its forcefulness. Nonetheless, it would prove an immense shift in American war doctrine, and, if the war is lost, we'll lose more money than men."
 USA_gld_68_mcnamara's_vision: "麦克纳马拉的愿景"
 USA_gld_68_mcnamara's_vision_desc: "In Washington quite a few of the big wigs in Goldwater's military cabinet, chiefly Robert McNamara, have had a mana from heaven realization; more troops mean we can simply swarm the RK forces with raw numbers. The Nazis are already reliant on strained slave labor conditions for their resources, even a good portion of their conscripts. If they can be exhausted thoroughly via good ole fashioned G.I. mass deployments and mass encirclements, they can be driven back, their resolve as well as their personnel depleted and broken. No nation on Earth save Japan could withstand the full blooming mobilization of America's young men against it all at once. Those paltry few that could would usually need weapons of mass destruction to definitively repel the pressurized application of so many well-coordinated invaders. Enough men will send the Reich packing, of this McNamara is positive."

 USA_gld_68_a_specialized_defense_desc: "The average grunt, noble though he is, is proving vastly insufficient to cope with the most battle-hardened RK units. In tandem with the adverse, novel climate in which the war is fought, such lack of veteran specialty in jungle combat is becoming disastrous for American forces. As such, the request has been made and granted for trained special forces units for whom underhanded, unorthodox warfare tailored to the difficult African climate is an object rather than an inconvenient resort. In lieu of overwhelming the Germans with old fashioned G.I.'s en masse, a more scalpel-esque approach will be adopted. Saliently, these divisions will engage the enemy in booby trapping, sabotage, guerrilla tactics, deep reconnaissance measures, skirmish and ambush oriented firefights; the genuine article of commando-focal warfare. If all goes swimmingly, the Nazis won't be able to out-adapt this rigorously versatile approach before it is far too late."
 USA_gld_68_better_vehicles: "更好的载具"
 USA_gld_68_better_vehicles_desc: "The country's armored warfare capacity is long overdue to be updated. This means introducing, manufacturing, and developing superior trucks, half-tracks, tank destroyers, and of course, tanks. With a fresh steel bulwark driving at their weary heels, the Krauts scarcely stand a chance. An increase in armored vehicles, particularly tanks will provide a boon, both literal and figurative to the average G.I. who will be able to call a much harder hammer down on skirmish prone swathes of RK-held territory. To boot, modern tanks can aid in the eventual push back to conventional war doctrine as the Germans are compelled to do battle in the open air as well as African villages."

 USA_gld_68_military_is_of_public_interest_desc: "Without our servicemen and their well-worked tools, the country's shores would fall to the jaws of fascism, and as such each sound man alive can see the import behind a well-muscled military. As a matter of national livelihood it should take a role on the center stage of government spending and prioritization. Greater portions of collected taxes will be delegated to the defense budget, and the budget itself will be marginally enlarged. Public support of the armed services will be encouraged, war austerity policies fostered, factory jobs lauded, and domestic morale safeguarded. The land of the free and the home of the brave will live up to its name under Goldwater as it has so many times before."
 USA_gld_68_land_air_integration: "空地一体化"
 USA_gld_68_land_air_integration_desc: "Aerial warfare is precisely President Goldwater's wheelhouse as a senior USAAF veteran, a period in which he doubtlessly learned a key lesson about air support, which is that it can only reify ground troops' ability to function for so long, and with only so much efficacy in being high flying craft opposed to enemies well-equipped with flak cannons. That is, until the modern helicopter. Mobile, speedy, low flying, and bristling with machine guns, a properly outfitted Huey chopper is the new Sherman, and arguably less fragile. An encroachingly irreplaceable element for American G.I.'s as it ferries them with facility, speed, and force to each front as battles ever-changing-ly unfold; providing a formidable hailstorm of leaden cover fire whenever needed. Synthesized with hardened infantry, the helicopter and its tactics are a revolution in American war-making ability."

The gargantuan demand for better guns has transformed into an equally exigent insistence for arms with growingly staggering caliber and destructive capacities. Larger artillery pieces, more efficient mortars, and bombs that can level the fortified installations which dapple the enemy's lines; anything with a bang big enough to ensure they think twice about advancing or sticking it out. The guns of Goldwater's service years are no more with modern technology coupled alongside the need to beat down a newer foe."
 USA_gld_68_limited_conscription: "有限征兵制"
 USA_gld_68_limited_conscription_desc: "With the war at hand, it is hardly unreasonable to start making some demands of those who live in this grand republic. Great men have to risk their lives for it without fail throughout the annals of history, and that time has come again, both for it and the liberty of our dear friends in Africa. Far from being lethally drastic; minimal conscription measures are what Goldwater has in mind. A selective service and lottery system will be more than apt to bring in the surplus manpower necessary to bow the head of the Reichskommissariats. Every man who gives his life for Africa's liberty will go down as a hero, and those heroes who haven't stepped forward may yet be found."

 USA_gld_68_lessons_from_saf_desc: "It occurs to any forward thinking man of war or the world that one can only wage war as successfully as he knows the grounds where he wages it. It's about time we took measures from the playbook of the local guerrilla fighters and integrated them into our own combat doctrines. As our allies they should be more than willing to aid the force superior in strength to them on their side. That might will only supplement their own so much if it is left to languish confused as it is consistently outwitted by a far more locally acclimated enemy. Spotting unique styles of booby trap, learning what to listen for in the underbrush, and understanding ambush positions in the foliage before they can be sprung among other things will all work towards our boys' favor."

More of the defense budget will be repurposed towards the manufacture of only the finest quality of mass issue small arms, and new designs befitting a jungle soldier's war considered for service. Flame-based and explosive projectile weapons capable of being fielded by small companies, platoons, and squads will also enter development and selection to enable their progress through the sweltering verdure populated with Nazis. There are few things that can overpower a vile jackboot, but a preponderance of arsenal in the hands of hardy G.I.'s is among them."

To put it mildly, this translates to yet another upping for the military's ever flowering new demands, with another matched-ly extensive addition to their coffers. War and its fruits are never costless, such is the eternal burden of free, fiercely principled nations who must resort to it against such tyrannies as the Nazis. Arms and armor manufacturing, conscription, and industrial production orders will all measurably intensify for the war effort's sake, without which victory is forsaken."

 USA_gld_68_more_men_more_munitions_desc: "It's an imperishable fact of armed struggle that you never know the lengths to which your dedication and nation may be tried. The manufacturing foundries which fuel the conflict's success must be tried yet further with an increase in locales, loans, and assembly lines to get more guns, gear, vehicles, and shells to the latest wave of valiant young Americans to stomp the RK's guts out. Regarding those courageous youth; there simply are not enough of them in the service to deploy against the Reich's tides. Conscription will be accelerated to meet the call of duty against the unrelenting Nazi specter. No man can fight forever, which is why fresh faces with fresh reserves of combat vigor must sally forth to crush the fascists head on. With their well-oiled tools, they will end this, for as Goldwater knows, you don't start a fight you have no intention of finishing."
 USA_gld_68_military_keynesianism: "军事凯恩斯主义"
 USA_gld_68_military_keynesianism_desc: "Keynes may have been a fool in most respects, but at least he grasped the needs of wartime production and the benefits it confers for the larger market economy. The debt we owe to our coffers is negligible against the backdrop of the ferocious clash throughout the bottommost ranges of Africa. The prospective boom from cycling against the ravages of war with raw production is tempting to say the least too. Reganist financial doctrines shift to reflect a Keynesian, demand-focused military industrial policy that the administration is convinced can give the desired push that will collapse the enemy's resolve through sheer, brute war production overclocking. The war has to be fought, and political economy cannot stand in the way."
 USA_gld_68_the_best_defense_is_a_funded_military: "军队越富裕，防御越强大"
 USA_gld_68_the_best_defense_is_a_funded_military_desc: "A full, Congressionally mandated budget increase for our defense has been called for, and with the raging, pitched inferno covering South Africa, it is inevitably necessary. If the Reich cannot be halted in Africa, Lord knows what they may be bold enough to attempt next, anything on the spectrum from strikes using weapons of mass destruction to another global conquest; the likes of which has not been seen for years. Safety can always be bought in more guns and war supplies, so why not secure oneself in the event of Reich getting any more audacious or threatening they already are? The war's continued frustrations are proof positive that it's a warranted concern, and that decisive victory requires decisive commitment with considerable sums of pure cash."
 USA_gld_68_a_modern_banking_system: "现代银行系统"
 USA_gld_68_a_modern_banking_system_desc: "The Interstate Banking Act of [GetYear] is now on President Goldwater's desk, one of his pet projects. For years the various states have put up barriers to the workings of financial institutions, forcing banks to keep their money in their states and not transfer the money where it needs to go. Some of the smaller states are pleading for more money to invest into their economies, but the larger states jealously guard the money, seeking to keep it where it already is. But with regulations slashed and taxes dropped, soon the local and regional banks that were long complacent will have to compete again, which will only help small businesses and entrepreneurs to get the financing they need to get growing."
 USA_gld_68_mortons_plan: "莫顿的计划"
 USA_gld_68_mortons_plan_desc: "Not everyone is on board with Regan's bold schemes to change the economic future of America. Some oppose it altogether, of course, but they weren't voting for us anyways. More importantly, however, is the opposition to Regan's plan within our party, led by Thurston Ballard Morton. Morton's clique, large and growing, objects to Regan's most outlandish plans and aims to reel his ambitions back in.\n\nTheir ideas heavily lean on massive expansion of trade with OFN allies, as well as using said trade leverage as political power in international politics. By strengthening our trade bonds with our allies, they say, we will both solidify our economy at home and our reputation abroad. It's important to note that these plans do not entirely conflict with Goldwater's own views, and that the President and Morton are quite aligned. Siding with Morton would, if anything, strengthen the President's bonds with the RDC.\n\nOf course, such an alliance would require compromising on some of President Goldwater's deepest-held values, and Regan is staunchly against any infringement on what he sees as both his and the Administration's responsibility. On the other hand, going with Regan would risk the plan failing in Congress - a much less likely outcome with Morton's plans, even if ultra-conservatives rejected the compromise in protest.\n\nPerhaps it's worth listening to what the moderates have to say."

 USA_gld_68_international_trade_desc: "While the US is one of the largest economies in the world, and has virtually every resource within its borders that it could ever need, it can't stand alone. In fact, it is imperative that America should trade with the world, especially with the anti-fascist Free World. The resources of Canada, South Africa, Australia and Latin America is worth a pretty penny, and they in turn can purchase products made in factories in the States, which will only require more resources, which will result in more money for them to spend on goods Made in America, and the cycle will continue, on and on, making everyone richer and happier. President Goldwater will be giving a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce tomorrow to lay out his plans to increase international trade, which should make all the businessmen there very happy."

America, as one of the few homes of freedom and democracy in this world, should not allow our hands to be dirtied by the gold and silver from blood soaked hands of the tyrants.\"\n\nOpinion polls had long shown that a substantial majority opposes trading with the German Reich, Italy, Iberia, or the Empire of Japan. However, the leaders of the Republican-Democratic Coalition, blindsided by the President's announcement, are horrified. Embargoing the largest markets in the world for being brutal dictatorships could cause a lot of economic chaos since the members of the OFN are a lot smaller economically, as they can't afford to buy all of America's goods. Even if it is popular, this new \"Free Trade\" policy is a dicey political and economic gamble."

But no longer. We will make the right choice. We must make the right choice!\"\n\nThe President has made \"The Goldwater Way\" position crystal clear: either stand with our allies and our freedoms, or to continue trading with murderers and criminals.

While businessmen in New York and the politicans in Washington in their pockets will complain, it's a popular idea with everyday Americans. After all, buying products made by slave labor or under oppressive regimes is tantamount to supporting them, and all red-blooded, freedom loving citizens of the US will never stop that low."

Luckily for us, we already know a large number of such nations: our allies in the Organization of Free Nations.\n\nWe will encourage further economic ties between the US and our friends in Canada, Australia and all over the world, rewarding them with lower tariffs and reduced red tape to ship their products to us.

The Capitol switchboard has been overloaded with calls from constituents to express their opinions on the bill, and unofficial tallies by the operators show that those who are opposed to it are outnumbered an outstanding twenty to one. Any economist or business leader who dared to publically state that banning trade with the largest nations on earth could be detreminetal to the American economy have been denounced as \"fear mongers\" and \"Nazi sympathizers.\"\n\nBut the bill has passed the House in large numbers, and with a healthy majority in the Senate, though some notable RDC members voted against it. Most of them won't be seeing re-election next time, Goldwater is sure. But in a ceremony in the Oval Office recorded on camera, the Free Trade Act is signed, and it's official. Though the results will take time to be felt as there has been a grace period of a year for most industries, Goldwater's approval has skyrocketed, and Americans everywhere are proud of their moral stance."

Big-shot liberals like to talk about their social programs and their massive government expansions, but they never seem to dwell too long on the price tag of their pet projects. Year after year, America has been forced to watch helplessly as their representatives drive their taxes higher and higher, ravaging their wages with inflation and bloating their government into an unrecognizable morass of waste and corruption. President Goldwater has no intentions of standing for this any longer.\n\nOne reason for this glut in spending is the almost comically weak debt ceiling that America has in place today. Weakly enforced and almost powerless in effect, the debt ceiling has been trampled again and again by the big-spending Washingtonians - a useless speed bump instead of a hard guardrail.\n\nBy working within the Senate, President Goldwater will change that. The debt ceiling will no longer be made of paper, but will be instead replaced with a concrete limit, a red line that tells Capitol Hill - and the nation - that reckless spending will not go beyond this point. Then, and only then, will the process of cutting government down to size become a true movement.\n\nAfter all, what good is policy if it gets reversed in four years time?"

Really, all they've done is strangle the life out of those entrepreneurial pioneers who boldly march America forwards, tightening the noose even as hard-working Americans gasp for help. It falls to us to cut that rope, and free the market once again.\n\nIn general, the smaller the government, the better, as Goldwater argues. Getting Washington out of the way of the liberty of the people to do what they'd like with their money and ideas is more difficult than it should be, but it is not impenetrable - soon, business owners will find their hands untied and free to build new prosperity for America to share in, and they'll know to thank the President for it."

Tax-and-spend liberals see no problem with this, of course, but President Goldwater knows better than to shut his eyes to the danger.\n\nThe interest rates that the government pays seem to grow every year, taking more money out of the average American's pocket, and it's past time that that trend was reversed. By contacting the Federal Reserve, the President will lower interest rates on the rapidly expanding debt, stunting its growth in its tracks. Not only will this stuff the growth of the debt, but it will also stimulate economic growth in the private sector. Goldwater wins, business owners win, and Americans win. What's not to like?"

However, it's been left to float free for a while now, which causes rapid rises and falls depending on the markets and politics. This has caused uncertainty and economic issues for years now, but now President Goldwater wants to stabilize the system. A whole suite of executive orders and laws have been proposed to keep the dollar stable. The goals should be to get the value of the dollar compared to the Reichsmark and the Yen, as well as OFN currencies, that should be perfect for businesses who want a lower dollar to encourage exports, and for companies that want a stronger dollar to make importing from other countries less expensive.

It is time to negotiate the North American Trade Cooperation Agreement (NATC). We will provide millions of dollars to help build up industries in both countries to the same standards as ours in interest free loans, and in turn we will make it easier for them to sell their resources, such as oil, food, iron ore, aluminum, and more, to America.

Other bonuses including reducing inflation, keeping government spending under control, and generally making the US a better place to do business with.

Even though Goldwater is a Free Market proponent, he has agreed to help set up a series of part private, part state owned businesses to help keep the economy going.

Free healthcare, free houses, free money all in the palm of your grubby hands -- but if and only if you'll tell some others to come work with them too. In such a manner does it get zealous servants while only paying them pennies and a pat on the back for their good work.\n\nUnsurprisingly, their spawn the trade unions emulate its progenitor. America's unions get membership dues and oaths of loyalty out of their peons, and nothing to give them but the euphoria of belonging to some \"higher cause\". A card of pyramids held together by simple gravity. But with one good kick, believes President Goldwater, it might just come crashing down..."

 USA_gld_68_target_their_leaders_desc: "尽管社会主义者把自己描绘成一股无影无踪、不可名状的愤怒浪潮，但他们组织的结构可比说出的妄言更切合实际。一群乌合之众，无论意识形态如何，总是会聚集在有成之士周围——这些人已经在他们的下级眼中证明了自己的价值，并有办法将他们的热情导向社会主义事业的目标。因此，我们的推论其实相当正确：一群乌合之众在没有领袖的情况下，会很快作鸟兽散。\n\n对于一个从无数暴民中获得力量的运动来说，同样也需要大量的领导人……这也是他们最薄弱的环节。在戈德华特总统报仇心切的政府眼中，下一步的执行计划已然就绪。"

 USA_gld_68_investigate_recruitment_methods_desc: "尽管我们开明的前辈曾期望美国是一个理性的国度，但在教会和理性的光芒面前，社会主义非但没有衰败。反而从每一个皈依者身上积聚了力量，渐渐长成了一头披着可怕血红旗帜的野兽。似乎没有什么力量能把它驱逐出去。社会主义就像一条九头蛇，每砍掉一个头就会再长出上百个。社会主义为什么会变成这样，又是如何变成这样的，这是一个问题，它驱使许多保守派借酒消愁，绝望地祈祷——即使是他们的脖子上已然被红色的绞索所勒紧。\n\n总统不希望再给社会主义者提供任何将他赶出白宫的机会。为此，胡佛局长将要求他的特工们揭开美国红色九头蛇的本质，探寻它在虔诚的美国人民中获得如此广泛的影响力的原因。"

 USA_gld_68_tighten_control_for_creating_new_unions_desc: "One does not end a disease by reintroducing the very risks that birthed it unto the corpus. The same can be said of any effort to definitively end the socialist menace; let foster the schemes which breed socialist thought, and there will be no end in sight for the riots and rebels socialism inevitably spawns.\n\nIn any case, President Goldwater already has his hands full dealing with the red bastards who've already organized. Painstaking progress has been made to isolate them from their sources of support -- progress easily undone if newer unions were to spring out like summer pox. He believes that imposing additional restrictions in establishing new trade unions will further weaken the extant unions to a point where he can do away with them in one fell swoop."
 USA_gld_68_from_blacklist_to_whitelist: "从黑名单到白名单"
 USA_gld_68_from_blacklist_to_whitelist_desc: "In dealing with American society's more seditious elements, the federal government's extensive security and intelligence apparatuses have taken to keeping an equally-extensive register of persons who had been, have been, or are suspected of having engaged themselves in illegal or traitorous activities. The thinking goes that such elements should be isolated away from where they can do the most harm. Spies and smugglers make up a healthy portion of these registers, although criminals and rabble-rousers form their majorities.\n\nThe converse of this \"blacklist\" is a register of individuals who have demonstrated deep loyalty to America and its laws. Investigating loyal citizens is a fruitless, wasteful endeavor; thus, President Goldwater believes his anti-corruption campaign is best served with a whitelist for the most exceptional members of his party."

 USA_gld_68_cross_check_senators_union_affiliation_desc: "It seems as if one in this day and age would be hard-pressed to find a bureaucrat or politician who doesn't shudder or break a sweat, even imperceptibly, whenever the term \"conflict of interest\" is uttered within earshot. Man is easy to tempt away from their duties with money as it is; with the stakes involved in the formulation and implementation of laws, money tends to appear to Beltway officials and employees like oases of manna in the dry desert. Incidentally, America's trade unions happen to be among the largest sources of this sweet, sticky fluid, tempting Senators with an ear for the common man with bribes for \"the common good\".\n\nThus, the Goldwater administration now sets its sights on Senators and their past and present affiliations. They can take care of snooping around for \"conflicts of interest\" with trade unions; an incensed public will do the bludgeoning for the President."

 USA_gld_68_deal_with_widespread_corruption: "解决普遍性腐败"
 USA_gld_68_deal_with_widespread_corruption_desc: "One of the key pillars of union support, the President long realized, is the Senate itself. To be specific, certain Senators in... \"labor-friendly\" states, in a manner of speaking. Lamentably, even statesmen of such caliber are not immune to pecuniary concerns -- and it is these concerns which bosses of ill-begotten wealth and renown offer to ameliorate. For a price, of course; after all, it is only fair for a man to ask compensation of equal value to his services.\n\nAnd so, with bare-naked bribes conducted behind doors, the reprehensible are shielded against justice's otherwise terrible reproach by a bulwark of pocket-bulging Congressmen. President Goldwater believes addressing this, with the hammer of public opinion if need be, takes precedence over other concerns."
 USA_gld_68_the_senators_payroll: "参议员的工资单"
 USA_gld_68_the_senators_payroll_desc: "No American likes to vote for someone whose actions go against their conscience, else they would not have flocked to those who present themselves as capable whilst without sin. An ideal world might grant their wishful thinking some physical manifestation; alas, no man in this sinful Earth is rid of it, not completely. And politicians, as centuries of human history has demonstrated, tend to bear more sins than any other man, in pursuit of their coveted positions. Senators are no different in this respect.\n\nIn most cases their reputation is their first and only bulwark against the truth, yet one which has proved its resilience time after time. But with the right attack ads -- messy, unglamorous, dishonorable attack ads -- at the right occasion, a skillful man can bypass this bulwark and illuminate these hidden sins for all of America to see."
 USA_gld_68_public_gift_registries: "公众捐赠登记处"
 USA_gld_68_public_gift_registries_desc: "Nothing angers the American more than knowing that their Congressman-elect has reneged on their promises in pursuit of dirty bribes... So what is there for a faultless man to hide? Surely innate righteousness would compel such a man to set matters straight the moment an avenue to prove his innocence lays open for him. For public officials, a tally of gifts and donations laid bare before their constituents is just that: An avenue to absolve the faultless from blame and sift out the corrupt from their hallowed ranks.\n\nPresident Goldwater believes the idea has merit, and plans to implement it forthwith. That it also impacts labor unions and their allies in Congress is pure coincidence -- a happy coincidence, but coincidence regardless."
 USA_gld_68_corruption_in_congress: "国会内部的腐败问题"
 USA_gld_68_corruption_in_congress_desc: "President Goldwater's ongoing campaign against the labor unions' influence in Capitol Hill has lit somewhat of a fire within the rank-and-file. Not a day passes without eagle-eyed staffers carefully scouring over documents and testimonies, ensuring every \"i\" is dotted, every \"t\" crossed and every check given to and received by every Congresscritter within the capital accounted for. Surprisingly, a good number of the accused don't even have ties to labor unions at all!\n\nThese recent developments indicate a slow, seemingly inevitable shift in scope: From a crusade against union lobbying to a crusade against Congressional avarice itself. Unexpected indeed... but not unwelcome, believes the President. Certain options may have revealed themselves as a result, and it would not do to overlook them simply because they were unaccounted for at first."
 USA_gld_68_equal_scrutiny: "平等审查"
 USA_gld_68_equal_scrutiny_desc: "The Republican Party has prided itself in sticking true to its core tenets since the days of Honest Abe himself. Let the Democrats have their reckless progress, and the National Progressives their utter lack of any such principles -- a hundred years ago the Republicans preached the virtue of limited and moral government, and God willing it shall still preach so a hundred years from now. Such is the respect by which virtuous men regard their time-proven principles, and the extent to which their words are fully practiced.\n\nAs a Republican with principle, President Goldwater's noble crusade against base corruption shall not discriminate by party affiliation, nor by any category for that matter. Under the eyes of God and Lady Justice, this he swore, shall all men be equally judged."
 USA_gld_68_deal_with_the_problem_at_hand: "处理手头上的问题"
 USA_gld_68_deal_with_the_problem_at_hand_desc: "The more news he receives from his dutiful staff, the more President Goldwater's antipathy is stoked and fed with the office paper on which their news is printed. By the several dozenth report on an exchange of sums between a defense contractor and a swing district Representative -- a Republican-Democrat, no less! -- the President was further convinced in his belief that his own party is no stranger to the very rot that clings at the underside of Capitol Hill's marble columns.\n\nThe American people deserve an honest government, a trustworthy government, a government that walks its talk no matter what. Not even the desperate pleas of his fellow Republican-Democrats will deter President Goldwater from making the moral choice; after all, is that not what any man who so cherishes his values should do?"
 USA_gld_68_blame_the_republicans: "指责民主党人"
 USA_gld_68_blame_the_republicans_desc: "Were it not for the extenuating circumstances America had found itself in after the Second World War, the Republicans would not have seen any need to caucus with the Democratic Party. In better days, good Republican sons would have thought their Democrat counterparts and the National Progressives one and the same: Profiteering tyrants with a frantic need to spread their perversions of liberty and justice from east to west. Somehow it seemed fitting that these two parties, so alike one another in policy, also share the same visceral need to buy with money what they cannot buy in the ballot box.\n\nAny further moves against half the President's government will certainly make tumultuous ripples in America's already-fragile politics. As ever, the President remains steadfast to the course he has charted."
 USA_gld_68_nationwide_corruption: "全国范围的腐败问题"
 USA_gld_68_nationwide_corruption_desc: "America's corruption, President Goldwater believes, is no longer the sole domain of any one party, race, or faith. It has grown with the country and its times, from the stranglehold of old England's noble elites to the stranglehold of the bosses of Tammany Hall; from the humble favor traded between neighbors to the million-dollar briefcases handed from profiteer to politician with the secrecy one would expect from the Manhattan than from anyone else. Corruption has seeped so deeply into America's cultural milieu that all its people, in some way or another, are complicit in its continued survival.\n\nSuch a dismal state of affairs cannot, must not be ignored any longer. To this effect, the President aims to extend his crusade against corruption beyond the Beltway until every government office in America feels its expiatory touch."
 USA_gld_68_its_going_down: "掘地三尺"
 USA_gld_68_its_going_down_desc: "After months of undeterred audits and hearings, contravening both alliances of convenience and pessimistic expectations, the Goldwater administration is finally at the cusp of concluding its great crusade against government corruption. In such a short span of time the country had borne witness to thousands of officials sacked, billions of dollars found missing, and lofty reputations from all colors of the political spectrum dragged ignominiously into the mud. Few were spared justice as the federal government exercised its powers to their uppermost limit in order to accomplish what other administrations could not.\n\nPresident Goldwater now stands atop the rubble he had gouged off America's latest party system, despised and praised in equal measure. Only time will tell if history judges his deeds worthy of proper reward."
 USA_gld_68_this_should_dig_them_down_deep: "给他们挖坑"
 USA_gld_68_this_should_dig_them_down_deep_desc: "Despite the language he employs, President Goldwater takes care not to lose sight of his original goal. Taken to his own rhetoric he may be, but the President's campaign began, first and foremost, to strike against the trade unions and their copper-laden grip over a sizable chunk of Congress. His personal misgivings with the Democratic half of the country's ruling coalition must not interfere with the ultimate goal of striking at the labor unions' greatest ally in the Beltway: The National Progressive Pact.\n\nThe crusade shall continue regardless, but the White House now exerts more effort on denouncing NPP Congressmen than his own party's for their sins. Several voices may cry foul at the barely perceptible shift, but their complaints are meaningless noise compared to the golden chance now before him."
 USA_gld_68_npp_is_to_blame: "祸首是NPP"
 USA_gld_68_npp_is_to_blame_desc: "Who, if not the NPP, throw before all others their support for the trade unions and their piggish bosses? Who, if not this party's leadership, stand behind these corpulent, greedy, upjumped foremen as they organize themselves into protection rackets with a wrench at every nut and bolt holding the world's workshop together? Who, if not its mindless peons, throw themselves unto barricades and innocent masses in the name of these rackets -- treason and sedition all but the handicapped can recognize without conscious thought?\n\nFires cannot be fought if their tinder and kindling are ample in mass. The President believes the NPP, now or never, must be treated for what it truly is: Tinder and kindling for the rampant inferno of trade unionism come to sweep America to a conflagrant fate."
 USA_gld_68_what_about_republican_union_members: "如何处置民主党的工会成员？"
 USA_gld_68_what_about_republican_union_members_desc: "With such a charged, polarized political situation, the American public is keen on pointing fingers at every last bit of corruption, both real and perceived. These witch hunts in all but name have supported the President's righteous crusade since its inception... but there have been times where their zeal becomes something of an obstacle for his plans.\n\nTake, for example, the Democrats affiliated with trade unions themselves. While questionable in their preferences, the organizations they endorse are proven clean and above board by the intelligence community; regardless, the American people have been quick to accuse these Congressmen of the same corruption that typifies the NPP. For the good of the coalition and sensibility, the White House shall disabuse the public of their preconceptions before they commit to worse actions."
 USA_gld_68_conservatives_are_honorable: "荣归保守派"
 USA_gld_68_conservatives_are_honorable_desc: "As the dust and rubble settles, this whole debacle has proven yet again a time-honored truth in America's political scenery: Conservatism uphold their principles better than their adversaries. Never throughout the whole campaign have they once been revealed to have stooped as low as the liberals and progressives in achieving their political ambitions. Whereas the NPP were beaten bloody over their illicit affairs with trade unions, the Republicans and (to a slightly less extent) the Democrats shone like diamond-studded gold, unblemished and untarred.\n\nWhatever the repercussions may arise from the campaign, American conservatism has surely won from it a triumph worth celebrating for a good long time. Three hurrahs for common sense and tradition!"

 USA_gld_68_some_unregistered_gifts_shouldnt_bring_it_crashing_down_desc: "Moral quandaries and dilemmas are typical of any government in any nation in written history, and rightly so. After all, decisions which change the lives of millions never come without benefits and drawbacks, and not treating them with the gravity reserved for dilemmas enables decisions that can easily undo centuries of sound governance in a fraction of the time. These dilemmas are uncomfortable to face, albeit a necessary discomfort for good policymaking.\n\nAt present, President Goldwater faces one such dilemma in the form of some... unregistered gifts, just uncovered by some curious government auditors. Would if they belonged to the hawks; alas, their receipts bore the names of elephants and donkeys instead. Perhaps hard times call for hard decisions...?"
 USA_gld_68_exonerate_the_rds: "为共民联盟开脱"
 USA_gld_68_exonerate_the_rds_desc: "The Republican-Democratic Coalition is the last bastion of normalcy that reigned before the Great Depression, and its two halves the architects of America's recovery in the leadup to the Second World War. It is the greatest compromise American politics has witnessed -- for two foes locking horns since before the Civil War to dispense of their enmities and join hands says more than enough of their earnest belief in the country's long-term future. A complement which hardly applies to the Frankenstein of an opposition that seeks to counter their every move in Congress.\n\nValues shine brightest in times of adversity, and through their partnership the Republican-Democrats have demonstrated values worth fostering in the country's otherwise decrepit and lackadaisical politics. President Goldwater sees no need to disturb this relationship by bandying empty accusations over their income."
 USA_gld_68_the_big_bad: "恶贯满盈"
 USA_gld_68_the_big_bad_desc: "Like a demon from Scripture, trade unionism casts its blood-crimson shadow over the good men and women of America. The sharp edges of its manyfold jagged teeth glimmer as daggers against pale moonlight, ready to sink deep into fair Columbia's unsuspecting flesh and veins. What sort of beast must it be that it can bear its terrible implements with little in either recognition or repercussion from America's God-fearing folk!\n\nFortunately, this red-tainted beast is not as invulnerable as it is terrifying. The American people united can be fashioned into a sword that strikes true at its heart, made sharper with whetstones of knowledge. President Goldwater plans to seek out notable actors to fashion such whetstones with their wit and charisma -- and as if by Providence's command, one promising Ronald Reagan has immediately answered his call..."
 USA_gld_68_the_afl_cio: "劳联-产联"
 USA_gld_68_the_afl_cio_desc: "The AFL-CIO has reigned supreme over the quiltwork of American unions ever since their Faustian merger in the mid-fifties. In the frightable perceptions of your lay American, this \"national union\" controls a nationwide network of bosses, bribes and vassals from their velvet chairs in Washington, like puppet masters toying with the marionette strings of their servile dolls.\n\nThis, of course, cannot be any further from the truth. The union today operates as its constituent parts have always had since the age of letter and telegram: A cartel of organizations that have given the country's labor geographical bounds, organizing them into territories for each to rule as they see fit. With the symbol they present, and the cracks they offer unawares, President Goldwater has made it his ambition to split this beast into pieces before he leaves office."
 USA_gld_68_the_attorney_generals_report: "司法部长的报告"
 USA_gld_68_the_attorney_generals_report_desc: "The Attorney General of the United States is the greatest legal consultant the federal government has in its arsenal. The President may represent the American people, but his Constitutionally-mandated lawyer represents America as a whole in courtrooms both foreign and domestic. His words carry the weight of a bicentennial superpower, and the targets of his ire become unwilling volunteers for demonstrations of its sheer resources and patience...\n\n...Which is why enlisting his help is crucial for the task at hand. By preparing a scathing report against the AFL-CIO, packed with all the dirt the FBI can get its hands on, President Goldwater will have all the excuse he needs to file a ruinous lawsuit against America's most malignant union."
 USA_gld_68_go_with_what_we_have: "打好手中的牌"
 USA_gld_68_go_with_what_we_have_desc: "Nearly two centuries have passed since the Founders have uttered their inalienable truths, and now truth is rarer than it has ever been before. Duplicity and corruption stain all discourse and business with murky black ink -- a putrid, oily and slimy backdrop against what in better times would have been picturesque communities filled with the pleasantries of brotherly love. But it is in such despair where pinpricks of earnest truth shine brightest, giving hearts the strength to lift their burdens one day more.\n\nPresident Goldwater's greatest weapon against the AFL-CIO is just that: Earnest, naked truth. He has faith it will carry him through better than Director Hoover's increasingly hairbrained schemes, at least."
 USA_gld_68_a_limited_case: "大事化小"
 USA_gld_68_a_limited_case_desc: "So many ways the case can go -- and if President Goldwater were being honest, not a lot of them had the victory he wanted to happen. On the contrary, most he thought of had him eating crow as the Supreme Court shoots his case down in front of national television and two hundred million pairs of eyes. This paled, of course, to the worst case scenario: Hoover's boys getting caught where they shouldn't, kicking off yet another political meltdown so soon after the Nixon scandal.\n\nSo in his wisdom, he decided to stick with the arguments he's absolutely certain will make a compelling case. All white collar crimes and old boys' networks, only sparking interest because of a fresh coat of red paint. Much less glamorous than smoking guns, but leagues safer and ironclad regardless."
 USA_gld_68_the_constitution_demands_it: "宪法的要求"
 USA_gld_68_the_constitution_demands_it_desc: "In his eyes, President Goldwater saw himself as nothing less than a devoted adherent to America's Constitution. And why shouldn't he be? The document is the bedrock atop which the nation is built, the basis of its core essence and distinctive character. The crystallization of the Founders' hopes and dreams, the fruit of their effort, their last gift to their children, that they may live and die free -- to deviate from it is nothing less than heresy against America itself.\n\nWith the rise of socialism, more have strayed away from America and into heresy. Any good American would be incensed at their gall, but only the greatest few would rise above as the Constitution calls loud for aid. Let her government's people be assured: They have placed their trust in one such great few last Election Day, and he shall not shirk from it."

 USA_gld_68_its_not_enough_desc: "Time was something President Goldwater had precious little, and his adversaries plenty; if they absolutely must, the unions can just dig their heels and drag the hearings out until half of America boots him from the White House next elections for doing nothing in their eyes. For a feat as big as bringing the AFL-CIO down, nothing's ever enough for him.\n\nFactor in the FBI, however, and... well, he'll have a bigger shot in bringing them down, at least. And wasn't it said that fortune most favored the bold?"
 USA_gld_68_self_made_man_self_made_evidence: "自作聪明的人与自导自演的证据"
 USA_gld_68_self_made_man_self_made_evidence_desc: "Director Hoover has prepared the documents: forgeries, stolen mementos, coerced testimonies. At the President's word, agents in every major American city will receive their orders and begin the largest ever infiltration campaign the FBI has ever conducted. Disposable, nondescript -- no less a John Q. Public than the civilian beside them -- and devoted to the crusade, the Director's pawns will see to it that America will wake up with news of socialist skulduggery conveniently unearthed.\n\nIf nothing else, all good Americans can have a chuckle over seeing 'self-made men' become undone by... self-made evidence, suppose to say."
 USA_gld_68_american_federation_of_labor: "美国劳工联合会"
 USA_gld_68_american_federation_of_labor_desc: "The American Federation of Labor forms one half of the largest socialist hydra terrorizing American labor today. But these union bosses have the genteel their 'fraternal comrades' don't, born as they are from the more respectable, well-meaning artisans of the Gilded Age: clerks, foremen, teachers. They carry themselves with the grace and good manners that befit their well-maintained clothing and unblemished countenance; again, unlike the unwashed masses that compose their 'fraternal comrades'.\n\nSuch differences have contributed to an underlying tension among the two, though until now their mutual antipathy against the current state of things has prevented it from becoming an ignorable issue. President Goldwater believes there is merit in exploiting the AFL's hypocrisies in full view of the American people, both to galvanize his cause's support and undermine theirs."

They demand the \"right\" to shamble into work with the dignity of a vagrant and exert no more than four hours' worth of work into the American economy. Fueled as they are by base, narrow-minded desire, it is a wonder how they were able to organize at all.\n\nThe President will not offer the CIO the same leniency he does to their 'fraternal comrades'. Director Hoover will be delighted to hear of more opportunities to practice his agency's competence in... clandestine operations, so to say."

Coffee was the blood of God Himself; however, even holy water has limits. And Barry felt he had surpassed every known limit it's ever had since he began his crusade.\n\nHe sighed, sinking deep into the Oval Office's velvet chair. God will protect His own tomorrow morning."

 USA_gld_68_the_yellowstone_speech_desc: "What first comes to mind when President Goldwater thinks of America's natural beauty is the mighty, watery bellows of Yellowstone National Park's Old Faithful. The ancient caldera's most famous geyser forcefully ejects jets of superheated water from Earth to Heaven, seeming to all and sundry like a wrathful pillar from the Old Testament. Yet for all its awe-inspiring power, Old Faithful and its adjunct supervolcano is helpless against the clouds of industrial smoke that clog its airs, or against the heaps of scrap metal that defile its lands and waters.\n\nThe President feels it is only fitting to announce his next great effort before such a strong, yet helpless creation -- for is that not what now best describes American nature?"
 USA_gld_68_the_enviromental_protection_agency_desc: "Despite his support for the states' constitutional rights, President Goldwater acknowledges that some responsibilities are too extensive for any one state to handle themselves. Aside from interstate commerce and foreign policy, he also believes environmental protection is a burden only the federal government can guaranteeably shoulder. Thus, a hypothetical \"Environmental Protection Agency\" will better harness the country's will towards the stewardship of its natural bounty than the quiltwork, often underfunded programs of its individual states.\n\nThe President has directed his staff to draft plans for such an agency, keeping in mind the likelihood that Congress and its lobbyists will approve of it. If they won't, then... well, the White House will cross that bridge in good time."
 USA_gld_68_anti_corruption_measures_desc: "It is said that Congressmen convene in Capitol Hill to vote bills into law, but convene on the backrooms of K Street to draft and plan them. Meanwhile, the big names of the donor circles would hover by Senators and Representatives' shoulders to ensure that these bills satisfy, or at least do not affect overmuch, their paymasters' bottom lines. An undemocratic travesty it may be, but such is as part of life in the Beltway as sunshine and traffic jams. Presidents who fail to take the lobbyists' grip into account become lame ducks after their first hundred days.\n\nPresident Goldwater thinks likewise -- but not to appease them. He seeks ways to instead sideline them with corruption charges long before they inevitably become obstacles standing between the EPA bill and the Resolute Desk."
 USA_gld_68_investigate_the_legal_possibilities_desc: "Good lawmakers know what provisions their bills can cover without running afoul of already established precedents. To the dismay of American environmentalists, we've had nearly two centuries of precedent in allowing our captains of industry to dismantle the country's forests and pollute its waters for the sake of progress. This trend had suffered somewhat in President Roosevelt's heyday, but not to the point where environmental legislation can pass through Congress without heavy opposition.\n\nNevertheless, President Goldwater has begun consulting his most trusted advisors regarding the EPA bill's shape. At this time, Secretary Regan and Vice President Judd hold conflicting opinions over how much power the new agency should have to fulfill its mandate."
 USA_gld_68_expand_the_national_parks_desc: "President Grant had made the prescient decision to set aside a parcel of America's thousands of square miles from civilization in 1872. Since then, the registry of the now-named National Parks have been updated 31 more times. These vast natural preserves are the jewels of our country's natural beauty, filled with flora and fauna only their ecosystems can support... but as it is the law recognizes only 32. We have much more than that.\n\nLet the damn fool Republicans, Democrats, and National Progressives call him a tree-hugging hippie as much as they like, but President Goldwater will gladly draw money from the budget to protect more square miles, enroll more of America's natural wonders into the registry of National Parks."
 USA_gld_68_increase_national_park_funding_desc: "We may pass however many environmental acts we wish, but the trees and fish won't care any less for the borders we set, or for the penalties we enforce. Governments will hence always have a need for people to uphold its ordinances involving its voiceless, unheeding domains.\n\nThe good men and women of the National Park Service are assigned this important task for all laws related to its special preserves. Like all federal agencies, the NPS needs money from Congress to do its job well. The White House feels they need the cash injection more than most, and has drafted this year's budget with the National Parks' proper protection and management well in mind."
 USA_gld_68_the_clean_water_act_desc: "Clean water is more than just water to safely drink. Clean water is water free of metals and plastics, for to water our farms and let breathe our fishes. Clean water is water free of taint, giving whatever landscape it courses a beautiful trail of shimmering blue. Clean water is water unblemished by the hands of men, made closer to Providence for its existence alone. It is through laws and decrees that such hands are kept away from such a precious resource, for as recent memory unfortunately shows, men are happy to corrupt clean water into impure water without the visible hand of government to chastize their foolery.\n\nNow more than ever, President Goldwater believes, the federal government needs such laws before America's fresh waters are polluted fully. He will not find many allies in Congress for this purpose -- the left prefer their handouts uncompromised by nature's laments, whereas the right bleat about yet another of a million supposed federal overreaches -- but the President himself remains undeterred over his commitment to walking life's narrow gate."
 USA_gld_68_send_it_through_congress_desc: "After weeks of compromising, appeasing, negotiating and strongarming, the National Environmental Policy Act is finally ready to be voted upon in both houses of Congress. For a bill with just as much bipartisan opposition as bipartisan support, the passage of one of President Goldwater's major pieces of legislation is by no means certain according to observers and insider information.\n\n...When asked about his outlook for the law's fate, the President said that he \"will personally see to the enactment of a greener America's herald, no matter the cost...\""
 USA_gld_68_a_green_future_desc: "History is wont to write hagiographies of its great men one moment and hurl diatribes of their failings the next. One need look no further than the esteemed line of Presidents to see this phenomenon in question: According to literature, George Washington was both America's beloved pater patriae and a slave owning tyrant. These very same books lift Abraham Lincoln up as a paragon of American virtue, at the same time denouncing his heavy handed suppression of American freedoms under the duress of war.\n\nDecades from now, Barry Goldwater will meet their inevitable judgement like the Presidents before him. What Goldwater will their narrative depict? He hoped it would be Goldwater the environmentalist: The ardent champion of the greatest among the American people's shared heritages. But it was equally likely that the Goldwater they paint will resemble a tree-hugging dictator more than a civilized man.\n\nWith a swig, Barry emptied his mug before forcing his attention towards other Presidential matters. He can mull over his reputation after he gets out of office. For now, America has an infestation of extremists to exterminate."
 USA_gld_68_shady_measures_desc: "One morning, when Regan was exchanging barbs with the Federal Reserve in the Treasury Building, McNamara was crunching his numbers in the Pentagon with Curtis, and Judd was calming long-time Republican donors in some fancy restaurant in downtown DC, Director Hoover made his appearance in the Oval Office with a modest proposal tucked in his underarm. Washington's own kingmaker was straightforward enough: If President Goldwater required the FBI's help in uncovering \"compromising information\" about America's extremists, then he need only ask.\n\nIn better times, the Director's offer would merit a warning shot for its sheer unconstitutionality. On the other hand, it would sure be nice to see the country's miscreants behind bars before they poison its politics any further. Maybe ratfuckery is slightly more tolerable if it's for a good cause...?"
 USA_gld_68_IRS_audits_desc: "Al Capone's sprawling empire of bootleggers and mafiosos went under not because of his misdeeds as head of the infamous Chicago Outfit, but because of a record of tax evasion sniffed out by none other than the Internal Revenue Service. Say what you will about America's pencil-pushing tax collectors, but they must have done something right if they were able to accomplish what so many commissioners either can't or won't.\n\nPresident Goldwater aims to use the IRS as a weapon like in the Prohibition, but against America's domestic enemies this time around. Targeted investigations over extremists' finances will eventually trip over a case of fraud, evasion or embezzlement, giving us all the excuse we need to shut their gatherings down when we see them."
 USA_gld_68_create_blacklists_desc: "\"To curtail the influence of extremism in the United States, the President has approved a confidential record of persons with confirmed or suspected links to extremist groups. The names in this watchlist shall be kept under heightened surveillance by the appropriate law enforcement agencies -- that means us, by the way -- in order to evaluate the risk they pose to the government and the American people at large through their activities.\"\n\n\"All evidence gathered from enforcement of the watchlist are deemed admissible under court. Under threat of expulsion and a minimum sentence of ten years, agents aware of the watchlist are forbidden from confirming its existence to the general public until or unless the President himself deems it necessary...\""
 USA_gld_68_focus_on_the_socialists_desc: "Fascism may be one of America's most hated enemies, but it is also among its youngest. In due time the inefficiencies of such an embryonic ideology will manifest, and its adherents will be swept like sand onto history's dustbin by waves of either reform or revolution. For the empire of liberty's ancient ideals, fascism is merely a twinkle it is destined to outlast.\n\nThe same cannot be said for its other nemesis. Clothed in blood-stained red parroting the false German prophet's heresies, socialism has left more scars on Uncle Sam and his children than all the world's fascists put together. Like the hydra of myth, socialism grows despite injuries that would kill lesser men, and it will return to our shores again and again until our cities are crushed beneath its crimson feet.\n\nAll American Presidents are duty-bound to cull socialism before it grows into a juggernaut. President Goldwater sees no reason to abandon this responsibility."
 USA_gld_68_ostracize_the_far_left_desc: "American politics is built from the bottom up in compromise. The system that has supported American politics since independence was thus also built to work only when compromise is observed and good faith assumed by all parties. Conversely, a few bad actors can send the government into a screeching halt with filibusters and quorums.\n\nFor the President, none fit the title of \"bad actor\" better than the opposition's ardent leftists. No middle ground can be found with men who stubbornly insist on wholesale nationalizations, state-funded bribery, and other such reckless, pie-in-the-sky policies. Nevermind Judd's advice -- America's better off if these men were excluded from its politics altogether!"
 USA_gld_68_infiltrate_the_NPP_leftists_desc: "In their reckless push for relevance, the schizophrenic coalition called the NPP has taken to accepting anyone who at the very least harbors a strong antipathy for the Japanese Empire. Its leftist subfaction appends the party's already loose membership criteria with a pathological love for socialism in any of its shades; so long as one loves Marx and hates Japan, in other words, they are free to wear the gold eagle wherever they go.\n\nThis presents an opportunity for the President to exploit: By sending plainclothes to join their ranks, digging for dirt becomes as easy as attending a rally. The information they extract will have much use in his hands, whether as \"informed predictions\" or... something markedly less pleasant."
 USA_gld_68_an_anti_socialist_education_desc: "The biases and beliefs we hold to our graves coalesce in the classrooms of our youth, hardening with age. Because a nation has such a narrow window to enculture its children with a shared identity, school curricula emphasize civic education as early as grade school or their equivalent thereof.\n\nSimilar logic applies to reinforcing their worldview from certain ideologies -- a man taught to steer away from socialism's allure in his childhood is less inclined to join protests and vote for socialist-friendly politicians than one whose tryst with it began in college. Consequently, inoculating the nation's youth from socialism entails enforcing anti-socialist curricula in all levels of education. This is a mission the President is all too happy to undertake."
 USA_gld_68_a_media_firestorm_desc: "If rumors are faster than the speed of light, then the only object faster than rumors themselves are rumors fed with kompromat. Additionally, the blazing trail they leave behind is enough to engulf entire worlds with a conflagration that ends only when the last atom of oxygen is fed to the fires.\n\nUp until now, President Goldwater had seen no need to liken himself to a slash-and-burn farmer. But with the overabundance of kudzu threatening to cover all ten million of America's square miles with a thick, suffocating layer of red leaves... well, he imagines Cronkite will spend a whole day thinking of a good lede for some of the scoops Hoover's boys digged up."
 USA_gld_68_conservatism_reigns_supreme_desc: "To the glee of President Goldwater's fellow conservatives, socialism has taken a bloody beating across all fronts of American life since he began his not-so-discreet war. Their reputations tarnished, their bases starved of new blood and their ideas thoroughly discredited, the NPP's leftists and their fellow travellers have either retreated from the public sphere or left our shores for more hospitable climes.\n\nThe President's party members have celebrated his victory with triumphant speeches and extravagant dinners throughout the Beltway. Some sympathetic, if unusual, fellows from the opposition congratulated him in private -- apparently \"despite (his) traitorous heritage\" to quote one of the letters verbatim -- for conclusively dealing with one of their party's unwanted sores.\n\nHe knew better of course. Only fools with the arrogance of Hercules, but with none of his strength, would say that the socialist hydra was slain for good. The President has merely done his part, and all he can do now is hope the American people will maintain vigilance for its impending return."
 USA_gld_68_focus_on_the_yockeys_desc: "社会主义也许是美国发展之路上的老对头，但就算保守主义者也能承认这两种意识形态能在自由和人权的价值范畴上达成共识。两者的相似之处，让美国人对社会主义并不陌生——甚至是深表同情——就算社会主义毛病多多。不管双方支持者在为人民创造和平和繁荣的方式方面抱有多少分歧，他们都可以放下心来。因为他们知道，出于双方的共同目标，对方最终都会被吸引到自己这边来的。\n\n另一方面，法西斯主义则把不带脑子的绝对服从捧上了天，百般吹嘘那些无所不能的强人。在美国，除了德国那套坚持把一个种族凌驾于其他种族之上的奴才理论以外，你绝对找不出另一种与美式价值更格格不入的意识形态了。为了与这个反自然的敌人和他们现在在美国的支持者作斗争，戈德华特总统已经采纳谏言：暂时搁置与社会主义之间的百年血仇。"
 USA_gld_68_wiretap_yockey_desc: "说的好听一点，弗朗西斯·帕克·约基就是法西斯主义在美国的大救星。纵然仇恨——有的时候，甚至是因为仇恨——从他唾沫横飞的嘴里喷溅出来，他的身边已经缓慢而坚实地聚拢起各行各业的美国失意者。他们都愿意从他嘴里听到让他们解脱困境的“救世良方”。这些方案经常带着约基的纳粹教父干过的那些残暴勾当的痕迹，主要就是肆意妄为的暴力和对那些在美国受保护的被压迫者进行疯狂迫害。\n\n同样好听的说法是，戈德华特总统对一个人十分厌恶，这个人出于对总统祖上的坚定仇恨而企图射杀他。某个实习生向总统发问，质疑他是否会因个人恩怨而下令用FBI渗透者的勒索去毁了那个人。对此，总统只是展露出一个会心的微笑，用一句先下手为强的箴言作为回答。"
 USA_gld_68_investigate_the_kkk_desc: "By 1960, the infamous cross-burning lynch mob had dwindled from its peak of six million in the Roaring Twenties to several thousand at best, united only by their opposition to the civil rights movement. Nevertheless, the word of Klansmen have hefty weight still in the sympathetic South, and they continue to terrorize unimpeded the lives of families throughout the Black Belt.\n\nWith rumors saying that the Imperial Wizard had professed his support for Yockey's burgeoning movement, President Goldwater now has an alibi to justify going after them in front of his advisors. All he now needs is a convincing enough excuse to lock them up for life..."
 USA_gld_68_dig_up_evidence_desc: "There must be something inherent to an extremist's mindset, President Goldwater wondered, that not only inclined them towards hypocrisy but also shielded their worldview from the dissonance it causes. The latest dispatch from Hoover's agents only confirmed his suspicions. Why else would a tablecloth parade founded in direct opposition to the evil that is respect for your black compatriots apparently enjoy their ebony as much as any hot-blooded teenager with a roaming imagination?\n\nPersonally, he couldn't care less about the smut some lynching schmuck consumes. The folks around him, on the other hand -- friends, family, Southerners, National Progressives? They probably will."
 USA_gld_68_crack_down_on_fascism_desc: "It was pitch black in the White House when the phone rang. Director Hoover's gravely voice carried through the receiver as pried-awake Barry Goldwater picked it up.\n\nHe reported that he had finished gathering every last speck of dirt on Yockey and his surprisingly wide network of donors, advisors, henchmen and advocates. The good Director likened the experience to opening a matryoshka doll: Opening one reveals another, and another, and another, all the way to Washington, D.C. and the party leadership. With the big names his agents had dug out, and the debauchery they'd kept far away from the public's noses, an anonymous midnight leak into the Beltway's press corps will tear a third of the NPP apart the following morning.\n\nThe bleary-eyed President approved Director Hoover's innocuous suggestion before he went back to sleep. The covers felt a touch softer than usual that night."
 USA_gld_68_america_is_no_friend_of_fascism_desc: "Watching America's fascists implode from the distance gave President Goldwater no small helping of satisfaction. How they hobbled into Congress with dishevelled hair and bloodshot eyes, making like cornered hyenas whenever their fellow critter passed by; how they delivered yesterday's stump speeches with sore throats and a fraction of the energy; how they sat next to one another as if they were bunkmates with Satan himself... the debacle that had played itself out in the days and weeks after was what he'd asked for and more.\n\nAlmost fittingly, Yockey was nowhere to be found. So much for a man who thought himself an American Hitler -- son of a Jew nipped his little putsch in the bud, imagine that! The irony was thick as buttermilk, and just as sweet.\n\nBut the cherry on top was a nondescript letter from one Gus Hall. Goldwater swore he could hear grumbling from the neat cursive that offered the communist's congratulations and thanks.\n\nAll told, America's true loyalties reasserted themselves as soon as its fascist malcontents began cannibalizing one another to irrelevance. No friend to the Reich's poisoned honey indeed."
 USA_gld_68_an_america_free_of_extremists_desc: "Barry Goldwater knew he had accomplished his mission not through some flashy watershed moment, but through normalcy's gradual return.\n\nTorn off a hefty chunk of their misfits, the NPP had finally stabilized itself into a rock-steady opposition with more in common with each other beyond foreign policy. Resultingly, some sense of common decency and good faith had returned to the debates in Capitol Hill -- minuscule compared to the genteel of pre-Depression Beltway politics, but present nevertheless. It was fair to say that, despite the rhetoric bandied about, Congress was the friendliest these last few days than it had been in twenty years.\n\nGreat men often tell of the long nights and sleep-tossing agony before and after making a hard choice. With the knowledge that his calls had cured American politics of a potent, fatal poison? Barry slept like a newborn babe."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_Cleaning_Up_Wallaces_Mess_desc: "In his fall from grace, Wallace also brought down a great many others with him to the pits of damnation. America's repute, as dragged along the mud as his shameful, forceful departure from the White House. America's trust, surely shattered like so many windowpanes in Washington after the riots subsided. America's faith in its noble ideals, forever tarnished by the scandals many had thought are beneath the hallowed office of presidency.\n\n[USA.GetLeader] now takes his place, immediately burdened with the ashes Wallace had left behind in his dogged quest to burn America down. Violence soars to a fever pitch, vigilantes run amok unopposed, green numbers turn red and falter and dip. None envy his position, yet everyone hopes against all hope that the last of America's dwindling old guard can bring peace where the Presidents before him cannot."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_The_civil_rights_dilemma_desc: "It has existed since the times of the Founders, lasting centuries of dizzying change without having changed itself. By its name America has seen blood spilled, families torn apart, loyalties and lands rent in twain, grudges etched into aged, unforgiving stone. In or against its pursuit America had been laid to its lowest point a century ago; not a few days ago, America teetered dangerously close to a deeper nadir, stopped only by quick action.\n\nAmerica has had enough. The people have had enough. Blood shall be spilled no longer. Peace shall be restored, ancient enmities resolved, bonds of brotherhood reforged. One way or another, civil rights must be resolved now, lest brother fight brother once more."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_putting_out_the_fire_desc: "Wallace's fiery descent left behind infernos that had quickly taken hold in all parties. Disorganized by the ongoing chaos, America's momentarily paralyzed politics can only try to douse its own fires -- or wait it out -- however it can before resuming normal governance.\n\nAs head of their own party, the President is obliged to take the charge not only in restoring order nationwide, but also in mending the party's burn wounds. Only when recovery has begun will they be able to return in a condition to represent the American people once more."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_calm_the_conservatives_desc: "Now that Wallace is evicted from office, people have taken to blame America's conservatives for his accession. Coupled with the reinvigorated debate on civil rights, and the conservative movement now finds itself both beleaguered from the progressives' renewed attacks and weakened from the infighting that characterized the terminal stage of the Wallace administration.\n\nThe President knows their hearts are in the right place, and that they feel remorse over having enabled such a disastrous presidency. By calming them down with token concessions in civil rights, the President will remove a major source of concern for American conservatives, in turn making them more amenable to cooperation."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_silence_the_progressives_desc: "The American left were more vocal in their opposition to Wallace than its right -- they possessed both the prescience to glimpse the inevitable state of his presidency and the will to defy him at every turn. After having been proven right, they both celebrated his downfall and loudly reminded everyone that they were right.\n\nThe President agrees with them with Wallace and other things besides -- but now is not an appropriate time to act smug. Such behavior will eat away at the slivers of unity the government has left; yet if they break away, then the hope of a functioning Congress will soon follow. For the time being, the President will reproach the progressives and their allies in private, and ask them to desist until we get things in better order."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_speak_with_both_sides_desc: "By some miracle, the left and right have finally calmed down. The heavy tension that had undergirded sessions after Wallace's impeachment has faded away, now replaced by the familiar vitriol exchanged by adversaries on a regular basis. Barbs may now flow freely in Capitol Hill, but no longer do Congressmen spend hours worrying over gridlock instead of running the country.\n\nWhile cooler heads prevail, the President seeks to better bring both houses of Congress into order. A few more visits and promises might just be enough to achieve this before the rest of the government falls into similar dysfunction."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_stomp_out_the_remaining_backlash_desc: "One way or another, America must resolve its civil rights dilemma before it can ever move on to verdant pastures. Thus, after months of deliberation, the President has chosen to side with the nation's progressives in their onwards march to a promising future.\n\nNot all musings went to the appeal of righting past injustices, however. Just as much effort was spent on predicting the fallout of such a move in America's conservative half. Needless to say, its displeasure -- though weakened by Wallace's self-induced damage -- will bellow loudly from atop chimneys, church steeples, and Capitol Hill's marble dome itself. Care must be taken to subdue these voices before they coalesce into a dagger aimed at our throats."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_focus_on_the_true_evils_desc: "Despite our manifold differences, every party in America's political landscape unanimously agrees that the nation's evils pale in comparison to the atrocities orchestrated by Germany and Japan, past and present. It is no exaggeration to attest that hatred of fascism binds the Union together as good as glue to sheets of paper. Which beast to prioritize is a point of contention, but progressive, moderate and conservative alike will shed no tears for either tyrant's inevitable downfall.\n\nReminding all Americans of this shared antipathy may be necessary to reorient the ship of state amidst the stormy waves of today's discordant times."

All it awaits is a handful of strokes, etched in black fountain ink, by the highest office in the land to become ironclad law."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_addressing_the_situation_at_hand_desc: "Ironically, Wallace did himself and his supporters little favors by attempting to reverse what progress America had made in civil rights. He sought to reignite the American people's passions towards a great crusade against tyrannical government, but in doing so had also inflamed the ire of those who saw past his bluster and civil veneer. He sought to advance the rights of states, but in doing so had compelled the federal government to commit many egregious violations against them. His hatred for the Black had instead became the Blacks' greatest asset. By the time his face kissed the White House's lawn, support for civil rights had reached highs unprecedented -- and he has only himself to blame.\n\nNow it is up to the new President to address the reintensified debate over civil rights. The task of bringing Congress to accord over this issue will not be easy, but neither will the President shirk from it."

After all, what well-meaning citizen won't at least feel irritation upon perusing the unconstitutional drivel marketed to cleanse the nation of an original sin? It is telling that millions of Americans still listened to Wallace's firebrand speeches at the height of his reign of terror -- in point of fact, much of the country preferred the despicable man over his equally-despicable progressive nemeses.\n\nLet not history regard Barry Goldwater as a politician devoid of principle. He shall approach his fellow conservatives in the Republican-Democrats in frank dialogue over civil rights these coming days, no matter the frantic calls for \"party unity\"."

He must know how to own up to mistakes as ably as he accept recognition for success, lest the world see only the fatal hubris of egoists in him.\n\nIn his weaker moments President Goldwater wonders whether people see greatness or hubris in him, despite his accomplishments. He was only human, after all, and not without the preferences and inclinations present in any man. These biases, so to say, make accepting certain facts an exercise not unlike herding rabid cats.\n\nFacts such as the public's reaction to his last veto. He had expected, and did receive, the well-wishes from good Americans, yes. But overall... well, perhaps the reds held more sway than he thought.\n\nBut no matter.

America's setbacks in bettering its civil rights may be the most notable, so capturing the public's imagination and attention with its violence and rhetoric, but just as aggrieved -- yet given far less attention -- is the dismal state of its education system. Underfunded and overburdened, schools all over the country languished for years as they presided over the lowest graduation rates in decades.\n\nThe wounds may have already been dealt, the President says, but it is not too late to stymie the bleeding and restore the quality education Americans had once enjoyed."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_refunding_american_schools_desc: "Whether it was an earnest, yet short-sighted attempt to save money or an attack on notable wellsprings of government opposition, few can argue the repercussions of the Wallace administration budget cuts on education: less skilled people entering the workforce, more dropouts who can't get a job, and an unemployment rate steadily ticking upwards with every quarter. In a few years' time, Wallace had single handedly impeded America's economy from improving for years yet.\n\nThis mistake must be rectified not only for the good of the nation, but also for the good of its citizenry. Effective immediately, the President will restore funding for public schools and educational institutions back to their pre-Wallace levels."

Cleaning it up will take time, and one can never assuredly say that things will go back to the way they were before his reign of terror. Regardless, the worst of the damage is being unwound inch by gory inch.\n\nFew elsewhere does this show more than in reverting his \"reforms\" to American education. Streams of money, once dried but now restored, have slaked the thirst of schools longing for new textbooks and classrooms. Teachers and students return to their desks in droves. Like well-oiled gears sprung into motion, the great machine of academia now turns with more rust lost and old smoothness regained with every gyration. If the President has [Root.GetHerHis] way, then this beautiful machine will never rust again."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_no_man_for_states_rights_desc: "The United States is not simply a single entity. Rather, it is a federation of fifty separate states, linked by the chains of perpetual Union through shared identity, and whose unified direction is decided by the consensus of an assembly of elected statesmen. This unique arrangement justifiably requires some form of leeway for the states subsumed into one politic to act on their own accord. In most cases, giving these states the powers they enjoy as Constitutional right is a goal worth lauding.\n\nThe same cannot be said for Wallace's own acts to \"improve\" states' rights. Put short, a man who wields the federal government like a mallet to force laws into Congress only has states rights as a tangential goal at best. We should best get to work undoing the damage he's dealt to an otherwise noble goal's repute."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_a_rat_in_sheeps_clothing_desc: "Never before has \"states' rights\" been so associated with segregation as it is today. As expected of a simpleton with little in the way of tact, Wallace never once erred from speaking of \"restoring the rights of states to choose their destiny\" in the same breath as \"keeping the equals separate\". Did he truly clamor for states' rights when he attempted to enforce segregation in the North? Or when he cut much-needed funds for public schools in the poorest of America's states?\n\nNo two ways around it: Wallace exploited the public's sympathy for the liberties of their states in order to violate these very same liberties across two-thirds of America. It will take time to untangle the mess he had left behind to local laws, but restoring faith in an integral aspect of America's political system is worth any effort."

Only through repeated exercise, and not a little guidance, can a victim perform as well as they used; in some cases, their past performance will forever be lost in the scene of the crime.\n\nRestoring the prestige of states' rights in this nation is no different. With the disrepute it had gained under Wallace's tender ministrations, only a proportionate amount of outreach and reassurances to the once-bitten American people can ever convince them to throw their weight into it again. That said, the South will surely look favorably upon someone willing to help their dearest cause at its very nadir."
 USA_gld_68_WAL_dissacoiate_from_wallace_desc: "America's liberals and progressives are prone to boasting that they alone have brought about Wallace's disastrous fall from grace, with their protests and riots. That cannot be any further from the truth. Sure, picket signs and police brutality catch the press's cameras like nothing else -- but what many ignore is the plight of the innocent conservative, who had either did not ask for or had been duped by the duplicity of Alabama's erstwhile favored son.\n\nDecades from now, the next generation will look back at this decade to look for lessons they can apply to their present. America's conservatives will not be found wanting in this regard."

 GLD.127.desc: "Despite the administration's best intentions, President Goldwater's desire to see Congress approve the creation of an Environmental Protection Agency have failed. Subsequently, citing the urgency and need to protect the environment from degradation, the President has signed the bill into law through executive order, bypassing both houses of Congress. The administration insists on the legality of the executive order, while citing its necessity in order to ensure America's nature is preserved. Some voices within the Republican half of the Republican-Democrats have denounced this move by the administration as authoritarian. Nevertheless, few others have protested at this measure of the administration.\n\nThe bill is a great step forward in environmental legislation. Regardless of his firm belief in laissez-faire, President Barry Goldwater has always had a special appreciation for America's natural beauty, enough that he would see it protected by the federal government. Particularly younger voters seem to agree with and appreciate the President's environmentalist tendencies, making it likely that he is to enjoy a small surge in support among this demographic.\n\nWith the bill, the President's bill has created a new federal agency: the EPA, or Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA will be made responsible for ensuring that all of America's nature will be preserved and not subjected to needless and excessive pollution, through helping develop and enforce environmental regulation in cooperation with Congress.\n\nThe President can rest a little easier knowing that America's beauty is preserved for the next generation."

The Oval Office was far more spacious than the one he'd left on Capitol Hill, and was still an unfamiliar space to him. Across from him, Vice President Judd adjusted his glasses and spoke.\n\n\"That's what you called me here for, isn't it? To get ahead of any unforeseen issues. I'm sure we won't agree on everything, but every President and Vice President since Eisenhower has needed to deal with that. I can't promise you my support on everything, but I can keep silent on matters that are less offensive to the Republican Party.

Now, about the cabinet- most of these choices, Curtis is a fine statesman, and McNamara is certainly qualified enough for the job. But Regan- Regan concerns me.

There was always going to be tension between Barry Goldwater and Walter Judd: the former was the leader of the conservative, libertarian wing of the Republican-Democratic Coalition, while Judd was the standard bearer of the progressive and liberals that called the RDC's home. It was a surprise to many when Goldwater asked Judd to be his running mate on the 1968 ticket. Many assumed that Goldwater would have sought a more malleable, meek man to serve as Vice President than the very outspoken Judd, who represented the \"Eastern Establishment\" that Goldwater rallied against during the entire primary season. Someone that could accept being second fiddle, little more than someone to bolster the demographics needed to win the election.\n\nOf course, Goldwater would never come out to say such a thing publically, even if it was true.\n\n\"I'm currently assembling my cabinet. I just wanted to let you know who I'm planning on,\" Goldwater said, handing over a piece of paper with some scrawled handwriting on it.\n\nJudd adjusted his glasses as he sat on the sofa, looking over the names. As he got further and further down the list, his frown got deeper and deeper.\n\n\"These are all Republicans,\" Judd said. \"I don't see a single Democrat, or, rather, anyone that isn't a conservative, Mr. President. This could divide the coalition, especially with certain voters.\" His voters, those that voted for the RDC because Judd was on the ticket.\n\n\"The people voted for a conservative government, Walter. Besides, you're here. You're at the table. That should be more than enough to make the liberals happy.\"\n\nJudd stood up, handed the piece of paper back. \"It's your choice, Mr. President. You should have the people that agree with you around the table.\" His tone of voice made it clear that he wasn't happy about it. He turned on his heel and left the room.

He rubbed his forehead, staring at the binder with almost two hundred pages of paper.\n\n\"You have got to be kidding me,\" Goldwater said, adjusting his glasses before flipping open the binder, to see an index that listed all of them in alphabetical order. \"Thirty years of welfare, and this is the result?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. President,\" Donald Regan said. The Treasury Secretary stood in front of the desk, shaking his head. \"The first thing I did was get my staff to create this, with a brief description of each program the federal government runs, so we can figure out what we can get rid of.\"\n\nGoldwater flipped the page to the first program, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, the AAA, and quickly read the description. \"Pay farmers to not plant some of their land, and sell excess livestock to the government?\" He frowned, grabbed the page, and with a satisfying rip, tore it from the binder. \"That's the first one to go.\"\n\nThe President stuck his finger part way into the pages, and flipped the binder there. The Works Progress Administration, WPA. \"Provide contracts to companies to hire unemployed workers to build parks, post offices and other public infrastructure. And hire writers, musicians and painters to create art?\" He tore that page out with a particular vengeance. \"The last thing the government should be doing is paying anyone to splatter paint on a canvas. If someone wants to buy their art, then they should make it worth being sold.\"\n\nGoldwater turned to the last program, the Veterans Pension Act of 1947. \"Provide a pension to all members of the US Armed Forces who served in the Second World War,\" Goldwater read. He looked at it for a long moment, before grabbing a pen. \"Getting rid of all the pensions would be a terrible move. But if a former soldier is healthy, fit, and working, I don't think he needs an extra hundred bucks a month.\" \"I agree, Mr. President,\" Secretary Regan said, a grin on his face. \"I've already marked about a third of the programs that we can get rid of without too much fuss. Most of the rest can be amalgamated, and then have their combined budgets reduced to an appropriate level.\"\n\n\"I want this binder to be less than half the size,\" Goldwater said, slamming the binder shut. \"By the time we are done, this should be a pamphlet, not a doorstop.\""

The fact that millions of dollars a year are being spent to prop up thousands of farmers in the South when their crops don't yield as much as expected due to the lack of fertilizer and overused soil has become the newest bone of contention with Treasury Secretary Don Regan and his supporters, who seek to let the free markets determine who prospers and who doesn't. Why would anyone be willing to pay farmers to lose money? If they can't cut it, then they should sell their land to more successful farmers and get out!\n\nAlready there are protests by farmers throughout the South at state capitol buildings and federal courthouses, angry at how the government has been treating them over the past decade.\n\n\"First all the Civil Rights nonsense, talking about making the blacks our equals. And now they want to destroy our livelihoods? There won't be a single free farmer left in Dixie by the end of the year if this happens. Everyone will be broke, or no better than a slave!\"\n\nAlready activists have been going to small towns throughout Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Mississippi, telling the farmers about what their RDC President is trying to do, and how they can fight back by supporting the National Progressive Pact, especially the Nationalist faction of the NPP. It remains to be seen if it will be enough to topple the stranglehold the Democrats have had on the South since the end of Reconstruction, but many in the RDC are clearly afraid for their jobs in the next election."

Slogans like \"The New Deal,\" \"the Fair Deal,\" and more have been bandied about for just as long. Every single one a further burden on the taxpayer, all of them a further expansion of the government.\n\nBarry Goldwater is going to be different. Instead of making the government fatter, he is imposing a strict diet. Gone will be all the silly letters. The bloated budget will be slimmed down. By the end of his administration, the US Federal Government will be a sleeker, slimmer, and more effective government, doing what governments do best: maintain an army, negotiate with other countries, and stay the hell away from ordinary Americans.\n\nThe problem is that a lot of ordinary Americans have been brainwashed for two generations, told that the government will always help them when they need it. Did you lose your job? Here's a cheque! Did you retire without saving up enough? Here's a cheque! Is your farm or business underwater because you made some bad decisions? Don't you worry, because here's a cheque! The problem is those cheques add up, and add up fast. Now the US is in debt and in crisis.\n\nThirty years of coddling, consoling, instead of toughening and strengthening. Americans now hurt themselves, and cry to the government to help them. But no more. It's time for some tough love. In order to save America, Goldwater is going to have to make some tough choices. Unpopular choices. Choices that others, like the lily-livered Democrats or the Fascist-Communist NPP are loathe to make. But he's ready to do that. Anything to save America from itself."

 GLD.20.t: "Meeting With Morton"
 GLD.20.desc: "The interesting thing about Thruston Ballard Morton, Goldwater mused to himself, was that he was such a profoundly uninteresting-looking man. If you combined the faces of all the members of Congress into one man, the result would probably look quite similar to him. Clean-cut, short hair, square face. It was hard to imagine such a non-descriptive man could wield such power - yet, here he was, facing the President down in the Oval Office.\n\n\"Mr. President,\" he began politely, \"it's the opinion of myself and my friends that Mr. Regan has gotten a little carried away with his plans.\" Goldwater's head cocked to the side, light glinting off the lenses of his glasses. \"His heart is in the right place, of course, but he's taking it... well too far with these tax and welfare cuts. Some of what he's pushing for is economic nonsense.\"\n\n\"I chose him for his role because I agree with much of that so-called nonsense, Morton.\" Goldwater responded. \"Frankly, I don't think it's nonsense at all.\"\n\n\"You may not, Mr. President, but the party doesn't agree. A lot of people are worried. I can't guarantee his ideas make it through the Senate.\" Morton replied, settling in his chair as he lined up his main attack. \"Now, I think there's more than enough room between us to compromise, especially on trade and the national debt. We work out a deal there, and I guarantee that whatever bill we put out passes. You have my word.\"\n\nGoldwater considered the offer for a moment - Morton was not speaking emptily. A fair number of moderates in the RDC would be sure to follow what he did. Approaching it pragmatically, he made his choice. \"Alright, you have your deal. I hope you're ready to explain to my voters why I'm going back on my words.\""
 GLD.20.a: "\"Mr. President, the voters don't care how you make the economy better. They care if you make it better at all.\""
 GLD.21.t: "国际贸易"
 GLD.21.desc: "For the past seventy years, the American economy grew by leaps and bounds. We did so by embracing ideas and technology that older powers, content with their empires and wealth, ignored or disdained. But we were never daunted by distance or space, by lack of expertise or technical knowhow. We forged our way across a continent, united Pacific and Atlantic with ribbons of steel, filled a land with settlers with the masses driven from their homelands. We embraced electricity, the assembly line, the telephone, the automobile, the radio, the airplane and most recently, the television.\n\nMost of these inventions were developed or created, or refined and perfected, here within the United States. But to achieve these great feats, to the point where we've made more steel than both Nazi Germany and the Japanese Empire combined, and built an economy and nation far richer than any in the world had seen before, we isolated ourselves. Tariffs were high, and trade limited. We shunned the outside world, and in turn, they shunned us. We contented ourselves with making our cars, our washing machines, our televisions, and selling them to ourselves. Sure, some would be exported to Canada, some to Mexico. But never in huge numbers, and only limited ways.\n\nBut tariffs and trade barriers is a mark of one of two kinds of economies: a young, struggling one, seeking to carve out their place in the world in the face of international competition. Or it's the sign of a degenerate and fearful people. Corrupt leaders and greedy businessmen who content themselves to grow fat off a people that are hostage to an economy of overpriced and underperforming goods, monopolies that seek only to further their own wealth and power by sucking it from their nation, instead of challenging the world, seeking new markets, offering good quality and service for a fair price.\n\nWe are no longer a weak and struggling country, so that excuse has no holding. But are we a nation of cartels and monopolies? Are we willing to just lounge and laze in decadence, letting our standards slip and prices rise? I say no. America can compete with anyone in the world. If someone can do something better, we should learn from it. We should be willing to embrace trade with the whole world, with no limits or restrictions. Now is the time for America to embrace free trade."

 GLD.22.desc: "\"So America, I ask you: do you want to trade with a people that use slavery and torture? Do you want to become the nation that sells to the butchers of men? Are you willing to spend money on products made in prison camps? I think the answer is clear.\"\n\nUnfortunately like much of American politics, the answer is never so black and white. While embargoes with the German Reich, the Italian Empire, and the Empire of Japan have been in place since the end of the war, they have steadily loosened and opened up in time: American TVs travel across the ocean for German beer, Japanese cars, or Italian wine. After all, with two-thirds of the world, and nearly half of the population of the globe under their sway, totally cutting links with the fascist and ultra-nationalist powers of the world would be like cutting off your arm. At least many of the big businessmen, many of them on the more right wing side of the Republicans, are oft to say such.\n\nBut there has always been an uneasiness, a disgust, with trading with such nations. Such goods are not readily available, usually for the simple reason that no one wants them. To drive a Mercedes is to mark you out as a German sympathizer, maybe even a supporter of Yockey's madness. To buy a Mitsubishi car shows that the thousands that died in the Pacific were in vain, to value foreignness and efficiency over patriotism and love of country.\n\nGoldwater, as the valiant anti-fascist he is, tapped into that sentiment in a big way. To him, \"Free Trade\" means more than low tariffs and few restrictions: it means trading with democracies, with nations that value freedom and liberty over totalitarianism and iron fisted rule. Many of the leading Republicans, businessmen serving their nation in Congress for a period before returning back to their family business or the big corporations, are horrified at this \"Goldwater Way.\" Some have even come out and said so. But the public reaction is overwhelmingly in favor of Goldwater's idea of \"Free Trade.\" It's even seen as a courageous act by an otherwise loyal Republicans, to stand up to the wealthy elites, to stand up for what he thinks, what he knows, is right."

Officially, it's been stated that the goal of the summit is to encourage more trade between the members of the OFN in a spirit of freedom and democracy, while still maintaining their strength and will to stand up to the Fascists and Imperialists in Eurasia.\n\nHowever, the US President has not been quiet about his desire to forge free trade deals and open more markets, which some of the smaller nations are hesitant, if not downright hostile to. After all, nations like Australia and South Africa, with smaller economies and businesses, would have to face off American behemoths like Ford, Standard Oil, and Boeing. With vast resources, skills and labour, the US conglomerates could quickly monopolize these new markets, undercutting their competition and driving the smaller, local companies out of business altogether. But at the same time, the thought of Australian Holden cars or Canadian Avro planes being sold into one of the largest markets in the world with little in the way of tariffs is also deeply appealing.\n\nBut once we are all together, with the diplomatic niceties of being greeted by an honor guard of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and a delicious dinner of wild-caught salmon in their bellies, the real work of international affairs can begin.

There are three paths forward, as far as Goldwater can tell. The first, and most simple, is to keep the Organization of Free Nations as a simple military alliance, focused on the external fascist threat from Europe, Asia, and Africa. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the more hawkish advisors are in favor of this course of action, to keep America and her allies focused on the true threat.\n\nAnother group, lead by the Secretary of State and those seeking to push diplomacy, seek to use the OFN as a force to encourage free trade around the world, especially with nations that may not be the most democratic or open, but are still important geo-political partners to the US. By convincing these nations to open their economies to the OFN, they will be tied even more directly to America, and those levers can be used in the future.\n\nThe final group, promoted by the Secretary of Commerce and business leaders, seek to make the OFN more than a military alliance, and even more than just to push for free trade around the world, but as the establishment of an entire economic bloc. Reducing tariffs, cutting regulations, and establishing common standards, all to push for more economic ties between the various nations, making everyone richer in the process.\n\nThe decision has been made, and now it's time for Goldwater to make the announcement.\n\n\"I've gathered you here today to discuss...\""

However, the bill passed with the majority support from the RDC and the more moderate members of the NPP, as it was fairly non-controversial in the halls of power. Outside Washington, though, some commentators have expressed reservations about the financial cost of removing tariffs, and some have talked about the impact on good paying American jobs in comparison to cheaper labour elsewhere in the OFN. There are also concerns over the unilateral action that is not being reciprocated by other OFN members immediately, over all the opinion on the bill is seen as a net positive for the US.\n\nWith the bill now on it's way to be signed by the President, soon the vast majority of tariffs will be erased from the law books, allowing products from all over the OFN to be sold in America without the artificial price increased by taxing imports. This will be a victory for everyone: the price of raw materials, oil, consumer goods, and more from nations like Canada, Australia, and South Africa will be cheaper for US companies and consumers, while giving an economic boost to America's friends and allies."

By allowing products from nations with lower labor costs, it could see many highly-paid workers lose their jobs, which would cause ripple effects throughout the nation. The Yockey branch of the NPP was even more vitriolic in their denunciations of the Free Trade Act, considering it little more than a tool to drag America into the morass of global politics, and damage their \"America First\" ideals.\n\nHowever, the impact could be even worse on President Goldwater than a failed bill to lower some tariffs: with the extremes of the NPP now holding the balance of power in the Senate, that can only mean one of two things: either Goldwater is going to have to compromise to get anything done, or he's already been rendered a lame-duck President.

However, concerns regarding the removal of tariffs, the dismantling of import quotas, the harmonization of regulations and the extension of copyright protections need to be addressed in the NATC negotiations. Labor unions in Canada and the US are afraid that big businesses will seek to lower costs by building factories in the cheaper and less unionized Mexico, while farmers in Canada and Mexico are afraid of being overwhelmed by American food without the import quotas they currently have, or Hollywood and American TV networks destroying her neighbor's cultural institutions. And of course, nationalist forces in all three countries are reluctant, if not downright hostile, to the idea of making all three countries more open, facilitating immigration, culture and trade.

Already some America's biggest corporations are announcing that they are planning on investing millions in Canada and Mexico on factories, while approvals from oil pipelines from Alberta and Veracruz are being sought to ship millions of barrels of crude to satisfy American demand. However, protests by Mexican indigenous groups that have had constitutional protections on their lands removed, Canadian farmers who are nervous of having the markets flooded with cheaper food, and unionized American workers afraid for their jobs have erupted across the continent.\n\nBut President Goldwater can be proud in what he has accomplished: he's made trade between the three major nations of North America open and free, and brought the US, Mexico and Canada closer together. With North America working together to strengthen their economies and ties, there is next to nothing that can stop the USA now!"

Namely that the former should be cut to the bone, and then some, and the later should be allowed to run free with next to nothing to hold it back. Some call it Libertarian, some call it Fiscal Conservatism. Barry Goldwater calls it Common Sense.\n\nEver since the Great Depression, Washington has steadily gained more and more power. At first it was welcomed: some make work programs to get the unemployed workers back to work. Then with the war and the mobilization for it, came inspectors, support for unions, restrictions, rationing of resources, all called temporary, all to win the war.\n\nBut even the war ended in humiliation and defeat, the technocratic, heavy handed bureaucrats and their stalwart allies in Congress doubled down, clinging to their offices and positions, throwing more and more money at every problem. But this only bloated every element of government, ballooned an already astronomical debt. Business was strangled under the increasing cost and frustration, leaving only those massive corporations with armies of lawyers to survive and stagnate, becoming monopolies. Unions too, for what are they but bloated bureaucracies that only survive to steal money from hard working Americans? The lazy and workshy, those that only have enough ambition to game the system for free money, now get checks from Uncle Sam to spend on booze and prostitutes, rich food and all the luxuries of a modern life, all by lying and cheating the average person. The American people became apathetic, weary, and resigned to this nightmare of red tape and thievery, undaring and meek in front of a monolithic entity of agencies, bureaus and departments.\n\nBut no more. Today begins the process of slashing through the bloated government. Programs are being re-evaluated. Taxes are being slashed. The debt will be erased. Budgets are going to be halved, and halved again. Thousands of paper pushers, whose only job it was to stifle everything about America, will be booted out to find some actual work. Those living the high-life on scamming the welfare system or squeezing the average man and woman for every dime will now have to actually find a job and be productive.

This has prevented farmers, entrepreneurs, and ordinary people from accessing resources that would allow them to expand their businesses, hire new workers, build new homes, and much more...\n\n\"Today I'm asking Congress to pass the Interstate Banking Act of [GetYear], which will remove many of the restrictions on the merging of banks, as well as reducing the regulations that are currently preventing many viable and hardworking people from getting the loans they need to buy homes, cars, businesses and more. This new act will also cut taxes and fees that the federal government places on the banks, to give them more money, which can then be borrowed by everyday Americans...\"\n\n\"It has been the policy of my administration, from the moment I took this esteemed office, to get the government out of the way, to allow the untapped potential of our nation that had been held back for years to flourish. This act that I'm asking Congress to pass, along with all the other programs and actions my administration have taken, will allow our nation to grow and prosper like it has never seen before.

It was such a pleasure to get out of the endless hurly-burly of Washington, with its filth and smoke and smiling monsters waiting to sink a knife in him as soon as his back was turned. Yellowstone's quiet beauty brought him back to the simpler, happier days of his boyhood, running across Arizona's scorching scrublands with his brother and his sisters. Every American deserved to grow up like that, raised in nature's loving embrace.\n\nThe director let the President know they were ready. Goldwater took his place behind the podium, his back to the expanse of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. The President had long been committed to the cause of environmentalism and the preservation of America's natural beauty, and he intended this to be his seminal speech to introduce the public to his love for America's National Parks, and to hopefully sway them to support his program for greater environmental protections and regulations. Goldwater often found it difficult to believe that so many Americans were willing to sacrifice nature's bounty in exchange for the pollution of industry and the soullessness of the urban sprawl. Taking a deep breath to steady his thoughts, he began.\n\n\"My fellow Americans. Today I speak to you from Yellowstone National Park, greatest among America's natural monuments. Fifty years ago, this great nation made the commitment to protect and preserve our natural heritage, for these parks belong not to any man but to us all. I would carry on this proud tradition, and revitalise our national parks so that they may be enjoyed by our children and our grandchildren, and all who come after.\"\n\nAnd so he continued, extolling the virtues of the national parks and laying out his plan to enact a series of programs to preserve the environment and help the national parks grow and prosper.

Hot as the Yellowstone Caldera.\n\nIt was official: his dream of a government dedicated to protecting America's natural places had come to pass. The creation of the Environmental Protection Agency would be made public the following morning in a press conference, when he would, once again, face the flashing lights and the dark eyes of the cameras he had come to know so well.\n\nKnocking back his coffee, Goldwater allowed a small smile to grow as the scorching liquid warmed the inside of his chest. He reflected on the obstacles he had skirted around or smashed through to bring the EPA into being. The corrupt lobbyists he had to silence, the local governments who needed to be brought into line, the difficulty of getting the details right with his advisors, and finally the bloody path he'd had to carve through Congress just to get them to read the bill. It had been a battle well fought, and a victory well earned. After the endless bustle of the past few weeks, the President was finally able to enjoy the simple pleasure of a hot cup of coffee and a moment's peace, as well as the knowledge that he had forever ensured the preservation of America's natural heritage."

Friends have become enemies, and opponents have become allies in a whirlwind of fear and panic. The forced merger of the old Republican and Democratic Parties, and the rise of the National Progressive Pact to form the unwanted, yet unbreakable two party system that has been with our nation almost since our birth, has led to ideologues and populists of both extremes. Screaming at each other on the radio and on television, and drowning out the center in a flood of hate and anger. The moderates of both sides, those that can agree on compromises and get stuff done. There has been no direction, no course. America is a broken nation.\"\n\n\"But today, we begin to repair it.\"\n\nIn his first major speech to the American people since his inauguration, President Goldwater identified many of the issues that faced America, including a divided political scene, a stagnating economy, and a listless population. But he also laid out his policy agenda, which is as bold and daring as any seen or heard since at least the Great Depression. While the details were limited, and Goldwater said that he would find the best course of action through discussion with his Cabinet and Congress, he promised that whatever it is, whatever he tries to do, it will be for the good of America as a whole.\n\nNewspaper editorials and radio commentators, those that often speak of gloom and doom, were much more upbeat the next day. Even Goldwater's opponents said they could respect the earnestness and forthright manner that he spoke, even if they couldn't agree with his prescription on how to cure the USA. But for those that voted for Goldwater in November, it was exactly what they wanted. A promise to solve the many problems that face America, no matter the cost."

McNamara's proposal of what compromises and amendments to make to his initial plan for the Environmental Protection Agency lay on the desk, the object of his ire.\n\nMuch to his irritation, the President was forced to admit that McNamara's ideas would certainly be effective at pushing the EPA through Congress and establishing it with minimal blowback. Unfortunately, there was a price: major concessions to the same polluting industries that the EPA was being established to regulate. It was, in effect, a blunting of the teeth. A domestication, intended to hobble the EPA and prevent it from tackling the big dogs. Sure, it'd do some good, but the richest and thus most powerful offenders would get away virtually scot-free, with only a slap on the wrist for the future crimes against the environment they were sure to commit if McNamara's proposal shaped the EPA instead of his.\n\nGoldwater's pen hovered over the dotted line. If he signed, he'd be tarnishing one of his longest-held dreams, giving the polluters carte blanche to continue raping the natural world in exchange for agreeing to follow a handful of token restrictions. When he touched the pen to paper, he felt the familiar fiery indignation building in his chest. Would Michelangelo have knocked off David's head just to satisfy his critics?\n\nThe President faltered, torn. It'd be easy to sign and endorse McNamara's proposal, just a few strokes of the pen and he'd be able to avoid the anger of his voter base, and the party conservatives, and the business community. But, said that other little voice in his head, this is what you've been fighting for. Don't let them take it from you.\n\nDon't let the bastards win."

She knew just how he liked it.\n\nAlready the President was pondering what the public would make of his new bundle of policies aimed at increasing the prosperity of the National Parks program by expanding the size of many parks and drastically increasing their federal funding. He knew plenty of the Democrats and the Progressives in the NPP would rail against what they saw as him taking money out of the hands of the poor and giving it to a gang of tree-huggers and mountain-climbers, but he knew, with just the slightest smile, that it wasn't too likely they'd be able to sway the public to their side.\n\nThe fact was that most Americans would be glad or at the very least ambivalent towards the good news that the National Parks would continue to be a major pillar in the preservation of America's environment. Of course, he'd need to find a way to actually, you know, pay for it, but that was something he could deal with later.\n\nFor now, filled with the lightness of being that comes with accomplishing a long-held goal, Goldwater rose and made a mental note to have every available newspaper praising his speech delivered to him as he made his way with his entourage back to Cadillac One."

Money makes the world go round, after all, and the marble halls of government are packed with those willing to have a few greenbacks stuffed in their back pocket.\n\nPresident Goldwater had been furious to discover businesses were working with politicians to subvert his environmental legislation, but his anger then was a pale comparison to the Hadean rage that burst from him when he was informed that major businesses had made illegal donations to pro-business, anti-environment politicians in exchange for votes. Lobbying is one thing, outright bribery is quite another.\n\nDriven by that ball of cold fury that burned within him, Goldwater decided to push the big red button and call out the corrupters and their lackeys who were so willing to undermine America's democratic traditions to continue unabated their plunder of the environment.

Nevertheless, they'd thrown around a lot of ideas, some of which, to the President's surprise, were even half-decent. After waking up, he had immediately started working on a plan of what the EPA should look like.\n\nAnd, goddamn it all, he was nowhere closer to figuring it out than he had been yesterday! Through exhausted eyes, Goldwater once again looked over his work so far, trying to make it all come together in his mind. The EPA couldn't be too radical, but it couldn't be limp-wristed either or he might as well just not create it. It needed teeth, but it shouldn't be so powerful as to completely alienate the world of business and their 'friends' in Congress. And, of course, there was the small matter of how exactly the EPA would be funded, meaning which program would have its budget drained to bankroll it.\n\nThe President rested his chin on his hand. So many problems, all requiring decisions. He couldn't let himself forget that what he was doing here was important, that it would change the lives of Americans for decades to come. Picking up the phone, Goldwater decided to arrange for a press conference to announce that the Environmental Protection Agency was more than just a dream, that he was serious about preserving America's natural beauty for their descendants.\n\nSurely nobody could begrudge him if he left the details until later.

The KKK and its predecessors have been monitored and actively engaged by the Bureau since the late 1910s.

Despite the Klan's ostensible support for law and order, they have actively menaced both the Bureau and any state or federal authorities who oppose them. Even so, the Klan has been consistently protected for decades by corrupt and/or segregationist state governments and courts, as well as many state police forces - overwhelmingly in the South, naturally. KKK membership within all three of these institutions is common throughout the former Confederate states, while minor branches exist in most other states.\n\nThe KKK should not be misunderstood as merely a pro-segregation activist group, Mr. President. They are a genuine threat to American citizens of all colors and creeds, so long as those citizens are not both white and aligned with their cause. Both ordinary crime - mostly violent in nature - and outright terrorism are standard practice for the group. Naturally, their main targets are civil rights activists and institutions which support them. You will recall the bombing of Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama - that was the Klan's work, though we still lack sufficient evidence to prosecute our suspects. That was only one of many similar attacks, which range from bombing to arson and murder.\n\nThe Director agrees that the KKK poses a serious threat to domestic stability and the lives of our citizens, and must be dealt with decisively as soon as possible."

 GLD.137.desc: "FBI Special Agent Arthur Crandall stepped out of the car. Exhaling a thin stream of white smoke, he dropped his lit cigarette and ground it into the asphalt. The puddles covering the parking lot of the Philadelphia Sheraton Hotel, remnants of that morning's storm, glimmered like countless diamonds in the rays of sunlight poking through the clouds. Around him, three unmarked black cars screamed into the parking lot, disgorging a dozen hard-faced men in black suits. Crandall gave the signal, and they strode towards the hotel.\n\nTheir deep-cover boys in extremist groups had finally uncovered actionable intel on the greatest threat to the United States, the infamous fascist ideologue Francis Parker Yockey. After worming his way into Yockey's circle, an agent had reported to Quantico that Yockey always had with him a suitcase filled with forged passports with false identities; Mexican, Swedish, Australian, no doubt as insurance should he ever be forced to flee the country. Ironically, his attempt to escape the law had attracted them to him like a moth to a light. Before the day ended, Crandall would see the Nazi bastard in cuffs.\n\nCrandall and his boys marched across the Sheraton's opulent lobby, making no effort to wipe their feet. He flashed his badge at an irate desk clerk, and, without breaking his stride, flung open the doors to the convention hall where Yockey and his coterie were supposed to be hosting a fundraising event.\n\nInstantly he felt something was wrong. A hundred faces turned to him, but none of them were Yockey's. Gorge rising, his eyes groped for the sign proclaiming the name of the event: Christian Mothers for Teenage Abstinence. Swinging his gaze back to the conventioneers, he realized with a lurch of the stomach that they were middle-aged ladies one and all. Spluttering apologies, he slammed the doors behind him.\n\nThe bastard had flown the coop! Ignoring their shit-eating smirks, Crandall glanced over his men, wondering which of them was the snitch, then gruffly gave the order to return to the cars. They wouldn't get their man today. He was, Crandall reflected with irritation, probably already sipping a scotch and soda in an airplane bound for South America. Well, a man like Yockey wouldn't run forever. He'd come back, and when he did, they'd get him."

Brushing aside the broken glass, he hurriedly shoved the items back in the box and stood, knees popping, to make his way to his backyard.\n\nDonald kicked the screen-door open and stumbled out into the warm Georgia evening, the cicadas playing their nightly symphony as the sky darkened to a deep indigo. Ignoring the simple beauty of nature around him, Donald made a beeline for his charcoal-stained old firepit. Without ceremony, he dumped the box among the ashes, squirted it with kerosene, and lit it with a thrown match. Tongues of fire reflected in his eyes, Donald watched the flames consume his robes, the dark green fabric of the Grand Dragon crumbling into ash.\n\nAlthough he told himself that what he did was out of simple pragmatism, Donald was afraid, a fear that would rule him for the rest of his days. He frowned as he stared into the flames.\n\nFollowing the radio's announcement that the Klan would be banned and its leaders arrested, a thousand similar scenes played out across America. In a single night, the power and organization of the Klan was decisively crushed by the President's agents, by methods of sometimes arguable legitimacy. Nevertheless, there was a change in the air. A new era was dawning, one in which black people could walk the streets without fear, their would-be tormentors hiding inside, peering with bloodshot eyes through the venetian blinds, forever wondering.\n\nWondering if today would be the day they got the call in the night."

Although the man himself has vanished, presumably on his way to safe haven in Europe or South America on a phony passport, we've torn his power to shreds and, in doing so, we've excised the pulsing tumour at the nation's heart.\n\nThankfully, there has been little backlash to our persecution of the fascist fifth-columnists lurking within our society. Yockey has long been a stain on the NPP, and as much as they'd love to denounce us for attacking their party members, they can't do so without looking like they're endorsing his sick ideology. After all, Joe Citizen has little sympathy for fascism after the humiliations heaped upon us by Germany and Japan.\n\nEnjoying his morning coffee, President Goldwater allowed himself a moment of quiet triumph. He felt like the hero slaying the dragon in those old adventure tales he'd read as a kid, all those years ago in the hazy Arizona of his memory. He'd broken the back of Yockey, the Jew-hater, the would-be Imperator. Never again would he or his ilk threaten America.\n\nThe President smiled as the sun crested over the horizon and sipped his coffee. It tasted like victory."

Our education system needs to focus more on the failures of communism so that we could prevent any possibility for a socialist revolution in the future.\n\nThis latest Senate-approved bill will accomplish just this task. The bill revamps the social studies class by adding our own anti-communist propaganda to further lead students away from the false glimmer of the red star. A Knoxville, Tennessee teacher described her support for the new bill, \"I mean, look at Russia when they adopted communism.

Some newspapers were reluctant, while others began bizarre campaigns against the Marxists, with one local Utah paper calling all leftists \"Communist Mutants From Space\". Even the more moderate positions of the Marxist Caucus are coming under fire for \"attempting to inject their awful beliefs into our pure American society\".\n\nSince the inception of this campaign, any newspaper, regardless of the amount of readers, will be federally funded for any anti-communist articles. This has led to a growing number of pro-Yockey and fascist newspapers gaining attention, especially in the South and Midwest, the old headquarters of American Populism.

We no longer poison people from what they eat, or injure them when they are building skyscrapers.\"\n\n\"Don has shown me a lot of research that shows that if we get slackers off the dole, and let companies actually, you know, make stuff, that the whole economy will prosper,\" Goldwater replied, trying to keep a calm demeanor. \"That will be enough to keep the RDC together.\"\n\n\"Not if we are sending thousands of people into starvation!\" Judd yelled. \"Are you willing to let that happen?\" \"If it makes the country better off, then fuck them!\" Goldwater bellowed. The argument went back and forth like this for half an hour, a clash of conservatism and liberalism, with tempers flaring and eventually Judd put his foot down.\n\n\"Mr. President, you have a choice.

It was just days after the election, and while the White House was still occupied for a few months yet, it was time to prepare the transition.\n\n\"Of course, Mr. President.\"\n\nGoldwater stifled a sigh. There was always going to be tension between Barry Goldwater and Walter Judd: the former was the leader of the conservative, libertarian wing of the Republican-Democratic Coalition, while Judd was the standard bearer of the progressive and liberals that called the RDC's home. It was a surprise to many when Goldwater asked Judd to be his running mate on the 1968 ticket. Many assumed that Goldwater would have sought a more malleable, meek man to serve as Vice President than the very outspoken Judd, who represented the \"Eastern Establishment\" that Goldwater rallied against during the entire primary season. Someone that could accept being second fiddle, little more than someone to bolster the demographics needed to win the election.\n\nThe bad blood wasn't going to go away, especially not overnight even with the victory in the election. But that didn't mean that Goldwater couldn't at least try.\n\n\"I'm currently assembling my cabinet. And I would like your opinion on a few of the posts,\" Goldwater replied.\n\nThat caught Judd off guard. \"Excuse me, Mr. President?\"\n\n\"I want to get some Democrats and liberals around the table. To show that I'm being serious about uniting the Coalition. Namely Health, Education, Interior, Labor. I know they aren't the fanciest positions, but I want to show that I'm willing to listen to different opinions.\"\n\nJudd leaned back on the couch, surprised at what Goldwater was saying. After all these months of helping to get a man that was against nearly everything that he stood for into the Presidency, he was now getting an olive branch in return.\n\n\"So, can I get your help, Walter?\"\n\n\"Of course, Barry.\""

The article all Americans are supposed to hold dear as if it were the Bible? Let me remind you of the First Amendment: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of the press, right to assemble, and the freedom to criticize the government. Arguably, Goldwater has taken all of these rights away from you; you have no rights as of now.

He didn't show much confidence in his responses, either.\n\nThe media's word on the speech was very unpleasant towards the RDC: many journalists called Goldwater the \"Opportunist President\" for his attempts to flip his beliefs to gain extra votes. Nationalist politicians considered Goldwater \"a cheating liar\" and \"the first bogus President in a long time\". According to a Gallup poll released after the conference, Goldwater's popularity with the American people decreased as much as 10%.

Officer Alistair MacKinnon was killed instantly, his partner Officer Brock Tarrant taking cover and calling for reinforcements. A tense 7-hour siege ensued with the perpetrators. An FBI negotiator was brought in from Quantico, but the perpetrators refused to respond to any attempts at communication and fired on police when they attempted to recover Officer MacKinnon's body, the dramatic exchange captured on film. On the Governor's order, the FBI was stood down and the perpetrators were engaged by riot police. By 8:45 PM, police had breached the house and killed all four perpetrators, all confirmed to be white males aged 22-38. They also took one unarmed white female into custody. Upon investigation of documents recovered at the scene, the perpetrators have been identified as members of a fringe-right terrorist group comprised of former followers of fascist criminal Francis Yockey. Though it may sound incredible, according to their records, the group, calling themselves Avengers for America, were formulating a plan to assassinate the Hollywood actress and outspoken left-wing activist Jane Fonda for her connection to the Black Panther Party on an upcoming film shoot in Maryland. For now, Mrs. Fonda and the residents of Baltimore can rest easy knowing another threat to their freedom has been defeated.\n\nPresident Goldwater set the newspaper down to look over the photographs. One filled almost half a page, showing Officer Tarrant in a particularly heroic pose, engaging the Sovereigntists as his fellows attempt to retrieve the supine body of his murdered partner.

Surprisingly, the all-American corn-fed football-playing beer drinking Maryland cop turned out to be as red as cherry pie due to his upbringing, raised in an odd socialist commune by a pair of avowed leftists.\n\nThanks to Tarrant recently becoming a household name, his public endorsement of Hall has had the same effect for the usually obscure leftist faction of the NPP, catapulting them and Hall to the forefront of the public's attention. To Goldwater's consternation, he'd already heard whispers about Hall using the momentum from Tarrant's endorsement to even further increase the relevance of the Far Left NPP.\n\nIrritating that a single nobody could have this much impact, thought the President. If it wasn't for that photographer being in the right place at the right time, Tarrant would still be just another Joe Schlub and Hall would still be an obscure nobody. Sipping his coffee, the President wondered what to do about the situation. He could put an end to their little commie propaganda campaign, but it might look like a restriction of free speech. Alternatively, he could just ignore it and let them have their poster-boy. No doubt they'd run out of steam soon enough."

Larger, more staffed and more stocked his new DC abode may be -- but the ingredients and proportions in use hadn't changed from his shack in Paradise Valley.\n\nThe Arizonan's recipe of choice was simple: Two sugar, one cream, no milk, five ounces of water -- just enough to keep the slightly sweet taste potent. He wouldn't trade it for any other mix in the world. If someone else prefers their coffee with more or less sugar and creamer then that was fine too. Any self-respecting man would tailor their coffee to their own unique tastes instead of letting someone else decide the flavor for them.\n\nBarry smiled to himself. It seemed fitting that centuries-old, future-proof wisdoms can be gleaned through the simple act of preparing Earth's black blood. But what did it say when half the country still acted as if they only drank instant coffee their whole lives? That wouldn't do at all.\n\nAs he stirred his mug with a teaspoon, Barry thought of the future. The country has no shortage of troublemakers who'd love nothing more than to herd the American people along like unthinking sheep. Strays from the flock, dreaming of the freedom they deserve, would be brought back by gentle-looking hands to await the inevitable slaughter. Plenty of those in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, banners red like the blood of lambs. In his weaker moments the desire to fight evil with a lesser evil grows strong... but it was far too early to make such a drastic decision.\n\nAmerica's new President took his first sip for the morning.

Aforementioned benefits were \"delayed\" due to supposed problems with their employer, all while payments were leaving their owners for their boss's pockets. The unions stifled all attempts to speak out against such cases of unfair treatment, either with community conformity or with brute thugs masquerading as their \"comrades\" glowering behind every eye corner.\n\nLeft with no other recourse, these men took the federal government's hand, no matter how questionable its presence, if it meant the chance to sterilize these reservoirs of corruption from top to bottom..."

Maybe then, its authors hoped, unions will be compelled to comport themselves to the image they promote... and show the American people how spectacularly they fail at practicing what they preach.\n\nNaturally, the now-named Union Recruitment Standards Act was received just as partisanly as it was written. Republicans bellowed their assent, Democrats muttered their approval, over half the National Progressives screeched their opprobrium, and the rest broke ranks and hollered their \"commitment to beloved principle\". America fell in line with their Congressmen soon after; needless to say, its discourse over the proposed legislation violently reflected the animus that had settled in Congress like miasmatic vapor since the Second World War.\n\nBut there is nothing else both its supporters and detractors can do, now that the bill has entered judgement by Capitol Hill.

Less sympathetic observers would describe the President's response as a diatribe spoken in bad faith.\n\nTwo hundred million Americans react as variedly as one would expect from two hundred million minds. The God-fearing families of the South and Southwest bore the same heavy heart as their President had carried in front of national television. Contrariwise, the working men of Yankeedom and the Pacific Coast paid less heed to the Arizonan's words than the riotous parties they held in celebration of Congress's decision.\n\nAs the minutes wore on and the denouncements petered out, President Goldwater ambled out of the screen after hurling one last snipe at his hated opponents, the trade unionists: \"Duplicitous hydras with Medusa's petrifying gaze,\" he said. Many Americans shared one thought as they watched their commander-in-chief leave the screen with an impatient strut:"

For such a vast, multifaceted campaign with many avenues of failure, diverging opinions on which strategy to undertake was perhaps more of an inevitability than he thought. At least there was consensus on who first to deal with -- that onerous honor belonged to the Senators sympathetic to the trade unionists' cause. Where American compromise stumbled was in these Senators' party affiliations.\n\nIn this issue his allies are split into two roughly even camps. The first he calls the Partisans, so named for their visceral hatred for the cretins in the NPP. One can even say their willingness to toss the opposition into the howling wilderness supersedes their commitment to ending corruption in politics, adamant as they are in ensuring that the campaign focus only on the leftists and progressives among the NPP's ranks. Nevertheless, they do raise some good points; chief among them is the fact that, should their strategy be undertaken fully, the NPP will leave this mess a shattered pot money can no longer repair.\n\nThe other side of the conversation is the Idealists: Noble men who rallied around the President's clarion call against the socialist menace and of their own volition. They suggest that the sword of justice fall equally onto both parties, else the people would see the campaign only as an act of hypocrisy. Notable in their rhetoric are suggestions that the Democrats share their adversaries' fate -- after all, have the Senators of New England and the Midwest not received their share of the red-tainted spoils as well?\n\nWhatever President Goldwater chooses will decide the course of his campaign hence. All wise men know to consider the repercussions of their actions. Whether the Arizonan will exercise his wisdom where it is needed most remains to be seen."

Dubbed the Labor Union Standards Bill, it aims to introduce new requirements in order for a trade union to organize with the federal government's blessing and operate within its jurisdiction. These include a clean record sheet for the past twenty five years, limits on the revenue they report to the IRS, non-affiliation with socialist parties active in the United States, and others.\n\nSenators from the National Progressive Pact decry the President's latest initiative, calling it \"(a) gross infringement on the American workers' right to organize.\" This sentiment has been echoed by the AFL-CIO, who have since called for nationwide strikes and protests against the Bill's passage in Congress.

Make no mistake: My administration will never cease in following through with its promises to their successful conclusion.\"\n\nThe American labor movement is in uproar following the bill's ratification. In a joint statement with notable activists, progressive officials and renowned labor organizers, AFL-CIO President George Meany rebuked President Goldwater for \"failing to uphold the political liberties of American workers\", and that the union will \"do whatever it can to prevent the American workers' rights from further attack\".

His calm tone belied the energy with which he delivered the announcement that the White House has filed a case against America's largest trade union directly to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe public's reaction was instantaneous, divisive, and expected.

Internal security within the courtroom had run itself ragged keeping its participants from speaking out of line and protestors from interfering with the proceedings itself. Although arguments were kept from devolving into bloody fistfights, if only just, the entire trial simmered with a consistent level of snide and creative insults exchanged between government and union throughout.\n\nNot that insults were all both sides could offer, of course. The Justices had their fill of evidence and testimony as well: Laws, prior court decisions, compromising materials, even emotional outbursts from several witnesses. Each side did whatever they could to convince the law of the other's guilt, if not their own innocence.\n\nBut there were only so many hours in a day, and everyone involved expected a speedy trial.

But he thought himself tough, that there's always next times lying in wait just ready to be caught with fresher hands, new opportunities to get what he wants where he wants it.\n\nHis copy of The Washington Times, just a few hours old, had crumples and tear notches with how tight his shaking fists latched onto its margins. In front page, bold text:\n\n\"SUPREME COURT RULES 7-2 AGAINST PRES. GOLDWATER\"\n\nThere was no getting out of this loss, that much he knew.\n\nWith a wordless cry he threw the crumpled newspaper aside. A hand reached out for a mug of coffee on the Resolute Desk, only to find no purchase. Right, he'd thrown that too, hadn't he? Now it was just fragments of wet, sticky ceramic on the marble floor. Hit the bird splayed at the center of the Oval Office square in the eye too. Cleaning staff can take care of the mess.\n\nSighing, he rose up and hobbled towards the windowpane. Warm and sunny outside, like the good Lord couldn't give a rat's ass about his loss. What did he do to earn His disfavor? Doing the good thing? Something to think about while he spends the rest of his term making like a crippled goose, then.\n\nUnbidden, the old verse from the Book of Psalms left his lips:"

Pure black's never easy to get used to, even after drinking nothing but it for days.\n\nBut it was easy to lash out when he heard the news. Lash out at his fellow Americans for not backing him to the hilt. Lash out at the Justices for letting the union bastards get off scot-free. Lash out at God for not sending him a miracle at the end of so much effort. Hatred was strong and raw then, so very tempting to wield.\n\nThankfully, reason quickly reasserted itself. He had his victories, the unions have theirs. He may not have brought the whole thing down, but neither had they gotten away without a nasty limp. He still has half of America on his side, and a good chunk of Congress to boot. His campaign's wounded and bleeding -- but it's not yet out. Never out, if he had his way.\n\nAnd so it was that he addressed his Cabinet later in the day, thanking them for the work they were putting to bring the unions down. They needed reassurance after seeing them \"come to naught\" against the AFL-CIO. No matter, he said, there's still everyone else. If not America's biggest union, then the bottom feeders nibbling at the scraps it leaves behind.\n\nHoover got a different message shortly after, in yet another of their \"personal conversations\" behind closed doors."

Its front page had a still of the Supreme Court immediately after the vote, captioned \"SC VOTES 5-4 TO CUT AFL-CIO DOWN\" underneath. The President felt his grin grow wider.\n\nSure, the union bastards got away in the end. But they also left behind a waterfall of blood as they shambled away to wherever dark crevasse they'd come from. He took another sip from his mug -- slightly bitter, just the right amount of sweet. He can live with a flavor like that.\n\n\"What do you mean, Speed?\" the President inquired. \"We'll do what we've been doing ever since I made the Oval Office my bedroom.\"\n\n\"The Court didn't do enough. Who's to say they won't get back up again?\" The Director swigged half his coffee in one gulp, before setting it aside.\n\n\"With the penalties coming their way, and the other laws besides?

This time he added twice the sugar and thrice the cream to the mug, before pouring boiling water to mix. Hot mocha seemed appropriate for starting a very promising day -- a little treat every now and then never hurt anybody.\n\nHe had every reason to treat himself, really. If bringing down the fattest socialist hydra in America didn't at least deserve a sugar rush on his part, then why bother celebrating anything at all?\n\nLast night's celebrations still struck vivid images in his mind. Good cheers rang throughout the White House as rich vintages, reserved only for special occasions, flowed the length of its hallways like life-giving rivers. His staff unstuck themselves from that one moment of disbelief upon hearing the decision by hugging and kissing each other as if Christmas Eve and New Years put together had come. He joined in of course. If the kids can have their fun, then so can this old timer with all the stress to burn.\n\nBarry allowed himself a gulp of rich, creamy hot mocha. Of course there'd be fallout; he heard fallout shouting and chanting slogans even from the comfort of his kitchen, sounding like gouts of fire sweeping a crackling inferno across DC. He can start putting fires out after getting prepared for another day in the White House. But for now?\n\nThe President downed the rest of his coffee with one flick of the wrist.

The nine-story compound had already closed for the day hours earlier; that the lights seemed to flicker from spot to spot roused the guard's suspicion that thieves had broken in. Entering with a spare key, he climbed the stairs hoping to apprehend them before they accost with stolen valuables.\n\nWhat followed was a scuffle with no less than three persons, fully clad in black from head to toe. Surprisingly the guard only received minor cuts and bruises from the group, who had suddenly fled after knocking him to the ground. Why they didn't bother checking if he was conscious remains a mystery, but it was one that proved to benefit the disheveled officer as he inspected what they had left behind.\n\nPapers covered the desks and floor, scattered haystrewn across the office. Drawers gaped open, now emptier without their paper -- but their more valuable effects were left virtually untouched. Cubicle after cubicle of upended folders and undisturbed paper bills.

Seconds later, they evolved into stomach-aching chortles that echoed through the waiting lobby and caught the attention of the handful early arrivals mulling about.\n\nRosie's laughter drew in their nods and smirks -- not at her, for some reason, but at James instead. He returned each with a level stare before leaning to his side. The womanly bell chimes lifting his spirits up smothered their suspicious looks somewhat.

He sees trade with the Fatherland as... not in their national interest.\"\n\nThere was a moment's pause, as Speer shut his eyes and gently rubbed the bridge of his nose. Finally, he responded: \"Get me Schmidt. Tell him to stop whatever he's doing and come here at once.\" At this command, the orderly gave him a quick salute and departed the office immediately.\n\nA furrowed brow was the only indication of the fury building within Speer's heart. After all his valiant effort towards détente with the Americans, this new President was simply about to throw it away to satisfy the whims of his electorate. He stood, pacing towards the window to calm his mind. Beyond the glass, Germania still bore the scars of the war. Trade was the lifeblood of nations, and without it a wounded nation like Germany would struggle to pull itself up from the ashes.\n\nA few moments passed before Helmut Schmidt strode briskly into the office. The concerned look on his face as he saluted indicated that he was clearly already aware of the situation. \"You asked to see me, my Führer?\"\n\n\"The Americans have restored the embargo. I want you to contact their government and ask them... no, you are going to tell them that we will talk this out. I will not allow our efforts to normalize relations be in vain.\" Speer did not turn from the window as he spoke.\n\nSchmidt nodded thoroughly. \"I will get their Foreign Minister on the phone at once.

 GLD.Speer.2.desc: "Robert McNamara had taken a break for lunch when his secretary barged in, informing him that German Foreign Minister Helmut Schmidt was on the phone. He supposed it was only a matter of time before they came protesting about the embargo, though he wished it had not come during his brief respite.\n\nHelmut Schmidt was a curious character. Despite his nation's poor diplomatic reputation, the man seemingly oozed a calm sort of confidence. Irrespective of the animosity between their nations, Schmidt was cordial as he spoke at length with McNamara.\n\n\"Mr. McNamara, speaking on behalf of Führer Albert Speer and the Greater German Reich, I implore your government to reconsider this course of action. There is much benefit to be had from trade between our two great nations, I'm sure you understand. I am willing to personally travel to negotiate with your President, in the interests of normalizing diplomatic relations once again.\"\n\nWithin hours of this phone call, McNamara sat in the Oval Office, recounting the discussion to President Goldwater. \"The Germans seem willing to parley with us, but the American public expects us to uphold our promises and stop trade with the fascists,\" McNamara concluded. \"I told him I would call him back with your response shortly. What do you want me to say, Mr. President?\"\n\nGoldwater thought for a moment. It was certain that America held the upper hand. Perhaps if he met with this Schmidt, he could twist the Germans' arm and get them to make some major concessions in exchange for a more lenient policy. Done well, he could really show the world that America was undisputedly a superior power to Germany. On the other hand, simply telling the Germans that no means no would be a firm statement in its own right, and stonewalling them would reinforce his voters' faith in his commitment to shutting off the fascist powers.\n\nAfter a discussion with his advisors, Goldwater turned once more to McNamarra. \"Get him back on the line. I've made my decision.\""

 GLD.Speer.3.desc: "\"My Führer... the Americans have-\"\n\n\"Yes, Schmidt,\" Speer interrupted gloomily, \"I already know.\"\n\nThe Americans had rejected the Reich's request for negotiations, and already Speer had been inundated with panicked communiques from business leaders whose property and staff abroad suddenly found themselves declared illegal. German businesses in the OFN were rapidly shuttering, and some Reich owned cargo ships had reportedly made a hasty retreat from American ports for fear of being arrested or even fired upon.\n\nAfter the two men exchanged some words, Schmidt left Speer to go and fetch the advisors for a meeting. Once more, Speer found himself glancing out the window at the scarred cityscape of Germania, wondering what more could be done. If he faltered here, this loss of prestige could prove damaging to his already tenuous leadership of the Reich.\n\n\"The Americans aren't taking us seriously.\" He pondered to himself for a moment. It was then he had an idea. It was unprecedented and downright improbable, but he had to try. \"They will not take Germany seriously, but perhaps they will take me seriously.\"\n\nHalf an hour later, Speer sat with Schmidt and several adivsors to discuss the situation. Amidst the chaotic chatter and contingency planning, Speer spoke up suddenly. \"Perhaps the Americans will listen if I talk directly to them.\"\n\nThere was silence at the table. \"Pardon, my Führer?\" asked Schmidt, incredulity barely concealed.\n\nSpeer gazed back at him, a determined look in his eye. \"We can arrange a meeting. In neutral territory; perhaps Switzerland? I am willing to speak to them there.\""

 GLD.Speer.4.desc: "\"You're serious? The Führer's actually proposing that I meet him one on one?\"\n\n\"I scarcely believed it myself, Mr. President. But the offer is genuine. I spoke directly with Mr. Speer on the phone, and he is insistent that he is willing to personally negotiate this.\"\n\nAcross the desk from McNamarra, President Goldwater sat back in his chair. This was certainly unprecedented. Barring the brief period of the embargo being lifted, relations between America and Nazi Germany had been cold at best, and their heads of state had never met directly. He stroked his chin for a moment as he considered the implications.\n\n\"Where would we even meet? I doubt he'd be willing to come to America, and I'm not stepping foot in that cursed country.\"\n\n\"He has proposed that you meet him in Geneva. The Swiss are leery of the Germans at the best of times, but they're willing to offer us neutral ground to meet.\"\n\nSo the man has clearly given thought to this, thought Goldwater. At first, he almost laughed. It was absurd, and quite frankly reeked of desperation to overturn the embargo. What was he supposed to do? Fly to Geneva, tell Speer 'no' and then fly back home?\n\nAnd yet as he thought on it, that alone almost sounded like a golden opportunity. As he had already remarked, the Germans were desperate; America had the upper hand here. To go to Geneva, meet the Führer face to face, and then before all the world tell the leader of the so-called \"master race\" where to shove it?\n\nGoldwater would be an American hero overnight.\n\nIt was still perhaps a simply unnecessary exercise, and he still had half a mind to refuse outright. But perhaps this was the optimal moment to show the Germans who was boss. After all, it was unlikely a despot like Speer was likely to change Goldwater's mind on anything."

He had expected this, of course, but it was nonetheless disappointing. And humiliating. \"I understand. Thank you for letting me know, Schmidt. You can leave now.\" Schmidt gave a final salute and an apologetic look before he turned and left the office.\n\nSpeer sat quietly at the desk and ruminated on this defeat snatched from victory. He had been close, so close, to repairing relations between two of the world's foremost superpowers. Alas, thanks to the whims of American democracy and stubborn American pride, Germany was back at square one. The loss of prosperity to both nations would be significant, but undoubtedly it would be Germany, cast in the role of pariah once more, that took the greater hit to its prestige.\n\nThe Führer sighed heartily. He supposed there was little to be done. The Americans had made their choice, and perhaps four, eight or however many years from now they would change their minds. For now, all he could do was lead as he did before. Pacing once more to the window and looking out at the city, he resigned himself to the hope that the people would struggle on regardless. The German nation was strong, and there were other partners to be made in this wide world. Germany would have to pull itself from the ashes without reliance on America or any other nation, just as it had done once before."

He agreed to the meeting. He is on his way to Geneva as we speak.\"\n\nSpeer slowly put down his pen and stared at Schmidt in disbelief. His long shot plan had worked. A moment passed as Speer collected his racing thoughts. Finally he stood, almost too quickly, and motioned for Schmidt to follow him as he marched from the office. \"Cancel my appointments for the week,\" he instructed his secretary as he passed, \"and have someone pack my travel essentials.\"\n\nStriding further ahead, Speer had an almost manic energy in his step as he conversed with Schmidt. \"We have much to prepare. This meeting is crucial for the future of our relations and for Germany's place in the world. Goldwater will almost certainly be playing from a position of strength and, well, I must confess I am no diplomat.\"\n\nSchmidt struggled to keep up. \"I understand, my Führer. I will help wherever I can. If you like, I can help you practice the negotiations.\"\n\n\"I would much appreciate that. I will need all the help I can get.\" Pausing in the hallway, he turned to Schmidt and took him by the arm.\n\n\"This is a historic moment. We must not let it go to waste.\""

 GLD.Speer.7.t: "Two Worlds Collide"
 GLD.Speer.7.desc: "Packing, preparing and flying out to Geneva took less than two days, such was the expediency of the federal branch for such an important occasion. As the plane approached landing, the Secret Service agents aboard began hurriedly running through procedure one more time, and for the first time President Goldwater began to grow nervous. Pushing back the more ridiculous scenarios like this being some harebrained German plot to assassinate him to the back of his mind, Goldwater himself began mentally preparing himself for the meeting.\n\nThe Swiss capital was undoubtedly beautiful, and sizable crowds had gathered to watch as his armored motorcade passed through. As he approached the designated meeting point, Goldwater wondered what Speer himself would be like. He had seen some footage of Speer speaking, in the aftermath of the German Civil War and several times since, and while he certainly seemed to be less of a firebrand than Adolf Hitler had been in his heyday, he was still most definitely a Nazi. Speer would almost certainly be speaking from a position of deluded superiority, which might make talking to him more difficult.\n\n\"It will at least make putting him in his place all the more sweet,\" he remarked to no-one in particular.\n\nThe scene outside of the hotel was intense as his car pulled up. Several Secret Service agents had gone ahead and secured the hotel, while some of Speer's bodyguards had done the same. The two groups regarded each other with a mixture of cold contempt and silent curiosity, but both maintained their distance and followed protocol. As Goldwater stepped out of the vehicle, another car pulled around the corner and parked a short distance from his. And out from the car, wearing a plain grey suit marred only by the armband of the swastika, was the Führer himself.\n\nThe two men stared at each other for a moment. Goldwater expected him to give some long winded remark about the pride of the German nation and then greet him with a Nazi salute. Instead, Speer stepped forwards with a slight smile, reached out his hand and greeted him, in English.\n\n\"Good afternoon to you, Mr. Goldwater.\""

And so the two had shaken hands, being immortalized in an image likely by now already circling through the world's media. The two entered a reserved hotel room along with their respective translators, with their security details waiting outside the doors.\n\nThe world leaders were tense as they sat opposite each other. They danced around the subject at hand for a while. \"How was your flight, Mr. Goldwater?\" asked Speer.\n\n\"Pleasant,\" replied Goldwater tersely, before pausing for a while. \"I understand that the reconstruction of your country is going well?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\" As the small talk wore on, Speer knew that they would soon have to face the subject at hand. He thought back to the angles that he had discussed with Schmidt, and weighed up his options. He could try to address Goldwater's concerns about Germany's past, using his reforms as proof that Germany had changed enough to appease the Americans' sense of righteousness. Alternatively, he could push for Goldwater to consider allowing his allied nations to sidestep the embargo in the interests of free trade, allowing Germany to retain some of its business ties there. Finally, if all else failed, he could resort to flattery to appeal to the famous American ego.\n\nA silence had begun to build between them. Speer knew he had to say something, or else Goldwater would surely grow bored and leave."

The two men sat together at a table. Several attempts at conversation were made, though the language barrier and the latent tension of the situation made the initial smalltalk rather stilted. Goldwater was beginning to consider whether this had truly been a waste of time, before Speer's face became set with determination and he began to speak in earnest.\n\n\"I will confess to you, Mr. Goldwater, that my nation has made many... misjudgements in its past. We allowed renegade groups such as the SS, and power hungry men like Bormann and Göring to wield power, and in doing so allowed terrible acts to be committed in our Fatherland's name. Understand that the Germany I rule over now is not the Germany of yesteryear. I can assure you that all we desire is peace, trade and brotherhood with the nations of the world.\" Goldwater listened as Speer's translator relayed this spiel to him, noting the translator's clear shock and discomfort at Speer's denunciation of his regime's past actions.\n\nIn spite of himself, Goldwater felt a rush of fury. Speer sounded sincere, but he was being careful. Careful not to implicate himself, or his dear late Hitler. Careful to lay the blame on his enemies, absolving himself of any part in the crimes of his despicable regime. Careful to present himself not as a snivelling minion of evil but a blameless savior. If ever there was a time to denounce Speer as the monster he was and make his bold exit, now was that time.\n\nAnd yet perhaps he could work with this. Speer wanted to present himself as a reformer; maybe it was time to make him put his money where his mouth was. He could offer Speer the trade he so dearly wanted, but only if he agreed to end Nazism, allow free elections, decolonize Europe, free the slaves and abolish his oversized military. If he refused (which he obviously would), then all the world would see what a hypocrite the Führer was.\n\nGoldwater allowed himself a moment's pause before he spoke."

The first was the look of clear shock in his translator's eyes at the words he was made to say. He supposed it was only natural - the man had been brought up to love his Fatherland unconditionally, so acknowledging its faults must feel like finding out a dark family secret. The second thing was Goldwater's reaction. The President was silent for a moment, but a brief flash of anger appeared in his expression. This was quickly replaced by what could only be a look of cunning, and Speer braced himself for what he was about to say.\n\n\"It is true that you have done much to reform your country, but I question how much of what you say is genuine. You say you are a reformer, Herr Speer? If what you say is true, then perhaps you will stand down? Allow the German people free and fair democratic elections and open up your economic sphere to the world. Perhaps then I would be willing to allow trade with Germany.\"\n\nSpeer stared for a moment, dumbstruck. Was this some attempt at American humor? He had made the effort to reach out, and now the American mocked him with such unreasonable demands! He was almost tempted to storm out immediately, but his thoughts caught on something. Specifically, Goldwater's insistence that Germany open its economic sphere to America. Was this not a little hypocritical, given Goldwater's strict missive to his allied nations to cease trade with Germany? Perhaps he could capitalize on this contradiction... or he could leave the arrogant American to his delusions."

He could already picture the headlines, the documentaries, the inevitable historical significance of -\n\nSpeer laughed. Not a laugh of nervousness or fear, but of amusement.

Or are you? I notice that you insist upon principles of free trade, and yet in your embargo you expressly forbid nations under the American alliance from trading with Germany. This is somewhat hypocritical, no? Especially for an alliance known as the Organization of 'Free' Nations. Perhaps if you wish to talk of openness, you should start by allowing the many great nations under the American wing to trade with whoever they please.\"\n\nGoldwater started. Then he stopped. And started and stopped again. He tried to think of a retort but fell short. Did Speer have a point? Goldwater felt sweat building as he tried to respond. If Speer made this same point to the wider world, perhaps the other OFN nations would agree. Perhaps they were right to agree?

While he didn't care much for politics, his interest peaked at a President which promised economic prosperity for all.\n\nBut that was then. No more food stamps, they say, it's a waste of money. We need to slash welfare; we could be using that for the environment, experts claim. Austerity, designed to bring economic prosperity for all and reduce the national debt, has simply taken it from the people who needed it most. Robert sighed, cold in his own home. Come next November, he's going to make his voice heard. Whoever is in that office, something is clear. He can't keep going on like this."

 GLD.flavor.2.t: "The Floor of the NYSE, 4:00pm"
 GLD.flavor.2.desc: "The final bell rang at the NYSE. The floor, busy as ever, was stopped in a dead silence. While there was ticker tape everywhere and every investor was itching to get home, the reality of what just happened finally hit everyone.\n\nThe highest single day DOW Jones rise in history.\n\n\"Gentlemen, everyone here today just made history!\" The room explodes into applause. A bottle of champagne popped on the trading floor. Stock traders from opposite sides of the room are dancing together. \"Tonight, your families will eat well. Little Suzie will get all the toys she wants for Christmas. You can finally buy that new car you've been eyeing for ages. Tonight, you will reap the rewards of the best economy in the history of the world!\"\n\nThe sound is deafening; so much so that spectators outside pause in the street in awe. Although the people on the floor were simple stock traders, all from different walks of life, one thing was clear. They were rich, and they loved America. And perhaps, one day, everyone would be able to flourish from the economy that they've helped create. Public confidence has been restored in a system that works for everyone, with equal opportunity for success. No more will John Doe be scared of investment, scared of starting a business, or making money. The American Dream seems alive again."
 GLD.flavor.2.a: "And in their cheers, a dream was born for everyone."
 GLD.flavor.3.t: "The Suburbs of Seattle, 6:31am"
 GLD.flavor.3.desc: "Joseph Miller was one of the lucky few seamen in his crew. Not many people made it alive out of that ship, but he was one of the fortunate ones. Ever since that fateful day in Midway, Joseph does his best working as a shift manager at a factory. The veterans benefits are good. He lives comfortably with his wife and two children. He's active in his community, gives rifle lessons, and recently spoke at his town hall. He was one of the many people who voted in the last election.\n\nToday, Joseph woke up bright and early, as he typically does. Usually he likes to start his day with a shower, and then reading the morning paper as Lucy makes him and the kids some breakfast. But this morning was a bit different. The paperboy came early. A few people were already outside their houses, so it must've been important. With a stretch and groan, Joseph opens the front door, and picks up the paper. \"NPP OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON TAKING MONEY FROM JAPAN\" is plastered on the front. Joseph rubbed his eyes, making sure that what he was seeing was true. With a pause, he closes the door, and sits down at the dinner table.\n\n\"Honey, what's wrong? Is everything okay?\"\n\n\"Yes, Lucy. Apparently the neighbors thought today's paper is interesting. I don't blame them.\"\n\nPeople in these parts voted straight down the line for the NPP. Maybe it was out of solidarity for our brothers in California. Maybe it was because of how hard everyone here was hit by the war. Maybe it was just how things were here. But the more Joseph read of the paper, the more frustrated he got. To think that the people he voted for are taking money from the people who shot down his brother's plane infuriated him. He puts the paper down, and sighs heavily. If there is change to come this November, it'll certainly not be for a party which is funded by warmongers."

The Supreme Court Justices completely slaughtered our attempts to bring down the bloated AFL-CIO, and now, more than ever, the fat unionists will only clamber for more and more American businesses to bring under its control. We fought for American liberty, for the very American Dream which earned us our independence; however, now all we can find is the sorrow of defeat within the Presidency, and a lesser and lesser chance at reelection as thoughts towards the future echo throughout the President's mind..."
 GLD68_afl_cio_weakened: "AFL-CIO Weakened"
 GLD68_afl_cio_weakened_desc: "The battle was fought, the soldiers of the law were deployed, the artillery of deliberation has been fired, and the cost of this war has been totaled. In the end, however, the wise members of the Supreme Court have realized the truth, justice, and righteousness in our cause against the AFL-CIO in an effort to realize a greater means of prosperity in our country! Whilst the Supreme Court did not fully obliterate the AFL-CIO, it did manage to create several impositions against the powers of the Unions and how much they can hamper large American businesses. And with this great victory for American business, so to comes the glory and respect of the American people for President Goldwater!"
 GLD68_anti_corruption_crusade: "讨伐腐败"
 GLD68_anti_corruption_crusade_desc: "Corruption within the United States government has grown far too large and far too powerful, able to sway the tides of Congressional legislation, Executive action, and even Judicial deciding. This cannot stand for the beacon of liberty that the United States of America acts as in this harrowed world; rather, the administration shall begin immediate action to combat potential sources of corruption. Furthermore, President Goldwater has realized that the NPP stands as a far greater suspect in the game of corruption within the United States; thus, it ought to be our highest priority to snuff out corruption amidst the NPP before anywhere else in the government."

This cannot stand for the beacon of liberty that the United States of America acts as in this harrowed world; rather, the administration shall begin immediate action to combat potential sources of corruption. However, unlike the rest of American governing, this stands as a wholly unbiased issue, and no faction of the United States government ought to stand as uninvestigated in this time of deep-seeded corruption, no matter the cost!"
 GLD68_union_whitelist: "Union Whitelist"
 GLD68_union_whitelist_desc: "Of course, outlawing unions in and of themselves would be a tremendously difficult, and, ultimately, wasteful task for President Goldwater and his administration. Rather, issuing a formal list of Presidentially-endorsed workers will be far more digestible for the American public, and allow us to help out those genuine workers' unions who stand to help the average American worker, rather than acting as bullies towards the great American businessmen across the country. Finally, we shall undo the curses of corruption upon the American market that the extremely bloated and overzealous union organizations brought upon it, and bring about a new era of shiny, golden prosperity for all the hardworking American patriots throughout the country!"

 USA_gld_68_WAL_separate_schools_arent_equal_desc: "\"Separate but equal,\" went the mantra Wallace and his cronies unabashedly uttered in front of the American people when they justified strengthening school segregation laws within and without the South. The white man cannot understand the black man fully, so they went, and neither can the black man understand the white man no matter their shared values and patrimony. Better that each race assign their own skilled to teach their own children, rather than coerce either race to fulfill a task in which they cannot possibly succeed. Again, so they went.\n\nThese seemingly sensible reassurances, expectedly, turned out to be window dressing for more sinister intentions. For while white districts carried on business as usual, black districts faced desolation from their already meagre budget dwindling into flies through a combination of budget cuts and redistricting. Clearly, separating the equal only furthered existing inequalities -- and the President aims to do away with the concept fully, despite the furor the South will raise."
