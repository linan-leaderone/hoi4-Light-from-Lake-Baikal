His duty is to make sure the Pakistani Army remains on the frontier and does not backfire on Afghanistan; being a loyal subordinate of Afghanistan, he takes to this duty with alacrity.\n\nWhen Shahabuddin Khan is not keeping a lid on the Pakistanis, he is governing his pair of small princely states in the northwest of what was supposed to have Pakistan. Many praise him for his efforts to modernize his state - he single-handedly funds schools, hospitals, fortifications and roads all over his domain. But just as many people criticize him for the ruthlessness he exhibits in his dealings with anyone he meets.\n\nHis absolute rule over the region ruins just as many lives as it uplifts; countless tribal groups hold him as their enemy for his incessant expropriations of tribal land for the purposes of development. The civilians in the Frontier Provinces outside of the Pakistani frontier or Jandol and Dir are not too impressed with him either; his absolutist, ruthless rule causes no small number of them to chafe under him, and there are rumblings of pro-Pakistani and even pro-Indian sentiment.\n\nFaced with all these things, the Nawabzada will do as he always has: assert his authority and suppress dissent until it calms down.

But that fact damages his reputation amidst the landowners that support the AIML, who do not appreciate the singular loyalty the MLNG shows. It also further damages him with the two professional formations of the Pakistan Movement, the Jammu and Kashmir Regiment and the Frontier Force, who both regard the MLNG as undisciplined louts and a liability to the Movement.\n\nFor now, however, Abdul Qayyum Khan sits securely.

 POLITICS_MUMTAZ_DAULTANA_DESC: "Mumtaz Daultana supported the idea of Pakistan early on, having joined the All India Muslim League in 1942. The ban on the AIML was no obstacle. Though Daultana joined the Unionists, he kept in touch with his former comrades and maintained such an extensive network that he became the underground commander of the Multan Division of the MLNG well before 1965.\n\nTo Mumtaz Daultana's mind, it should thus have stood to reason that he would assume the position of Prime Minister once the war had finished. It was much to his disgust that Daultana found that Feroz Khan Noon—his old family rival—had gained Punjabi aristocratic backing before Daultana could persuade the former Unionists to get behind him.\n\nBut all things come to an end. Feroz Khan Noon fell, and the aristocrats fell in behind Mumtaz Daultana. It was not just them, either. The clerical parties have all thrown their backing behind the new Daultana administration. If Mumtaz Daultana can survive the backlash from the firestorm that the clerics wish to unleash on the religious minorities of Pakistan, they may yet be able to raise him to an even higher dignity than that of Prime Minister."

But inside, all there was was a few slivers of light, the carpet machines, the screaming foreman demanding more, and work unceasing. The few children that managed somehow to get hold of books could hardly read them. If they had been able to read, they might have known what this was—debt slavery—but they spent the time a German child would have spent on learning instead bent over the loom and so stood no chance of knowing.\n\nIt took several children getting hurt before the latest carpet was made ready. The foreman all but tore the carpet from them and took it to the factory owner, who looked at it approvingly. It may not have been the factory's best work, but which German would know to appraise it correctly?\n\nThe factory owner sold the carpet to a middleman. For an instant he thought to take some money off their debts as a reward.. He squelched the impulse—the debts would never be paid off even if he did. Besides, he needed every paisa for his next mansion, or to buy more looms which the children would work over. He turned around and shouted at another group of children to work faster.\n\nWhen the carpet reached the Führer's office, he had it laid down on the floor before a place of honour where Hitler's portrait hung. He gazed at it admiringly, and spared no thoughts for anything but its beauty. Its origin did not matter—and he would not have cared even if he had known."
