###国家精神###
 AM_salted_earth: "不毛之地"
 AM_salted_earth_desc: "摄政的神圣俄罗斯帝国留给俄罗斯母亲的只有瓦砾丘墟，这是在统一过程中滥用化学武器打击叛军及其他敌人所酿成的恶果。大片肥沃的土地被荼毒，昔日重要的水源被污染，森林也成片枯萎。在帝国崩溃后的俄罗斯废土，未受污染的食物与水源已经千金难求，祖国母亲的子孙后代将要世世代代承受这苦难。"
 TMA_nothing_left_but_the_people: "惟余人民"
 TMA_nothing_left_but_the_people_desc: "北俄解放阵线并没有解放俄罗斯其他地区的宏伟梦想，即便如此，他们仍会誓死捍卫眼前所珍惜的一切。在这片荒原上，除了对抗拉里奥诺夫之外，阵线别无所求——意识形态、希望或野心，都已是过眼云烟。对阵线苦战的战士来说，希望不过是通往绝望之路的起点。"
 TMA_impossible_position: "不可思议的立场"
 TMA_impossible_position_desc: "即便阿尔图宁和阵线对芬兰政权的观感不甚良好，但是为了能用芬兰援助养活人民并尽量摆脱饥馑，他们还是做出了最艰难的选择——与芬兰人合作。"
 TMV_corporate_pillars: "企业支柱"
 TMV_corporate_pillars_desc: "帝国贸易财团是一个公私共管的机构，董事会由塔博里茨基帝国设立的企业组成。财团内的企业，都拥有自己说了算的封地——中央政权的货币只是大企业的代价券罢了，机构本身则是靠幕后交易来运转。"
 TMV_fraying_strings: "听调不听宣"
 TMV_fraying_strings_desc: "虽然帝国财团为摄政府的东部法理领土，但它已经看清了局势，开始自主行动。它们对拉里奥诺夫阳奉阴违，正在尝试与这个垂死的怪物划清界限。"
 KOM_imperium_nihilus: "帝国暗面"
 KOM_imperium_nihilus_desc: "塔博里茨基掏空了俄国，而拉里奥诺夫为了确保政府只效忠于他，展开了大清洗。现在的神圣俄罗斯帝国，可以说是什么都不剩了。突击队消耗殆尽后，军队很难维持充足的装备。田地被荼毒，人民在挨饿，帝国的统治仅仅是由它存下的恐怖武器和强制耕作来维持存续。"
 KOM_hermit_kingdom: "隐士王国"
 KOM_hermit_kingdom_desc: "尽管拉里奥诺夫怀有统一俄罗斯、恢复帝国的宏伟愿景，但他的神圣俄罗斯帝国不过是一个由缺兵少将的军队所守护的贱民国家，而军队的忠诚仅仅是出于恐惧和财富的承诺。拉里奥诺夫的帝国与俄罗斯其他地区隔绝，它与其他军阀的唯一互动就是劫掠和袭击通信线。"
 TMS_beacon_in_the_wastes: "废土灯塔"
 TMS_beacon_in_the_wastes_desc: "作为后塔博里茨基时代最繁荣稳定的国家之一，萨马拉基督共和国吸引着大量不远万里赶来寻求救赎的难民们。虽然神职人员们非常欢迎他们的到来，同时萨马拉市也需要大量劳动力来重建该地区的基础设施，某些人仍将朝圣者视为可能的威胁——最坏的情况便是伪装的帝国特工。"
 TMS_blessed_isolation: "光荣孤立"
 TMS_blessed_isolation_desc: "虽然萨马拉政府怀有普渡众生之心，但神职人员放眼望去，国境线外只能看到一群被扭曲的异端宗教所荼毒的堕落罪恶之地。基督共和国并不会把精力放在统一这个已经无可救药的俄罗斯上。"
 TML_not_yet_lost: "仍未灭亡"
 TML_not_yet_lost_desc: "苏维埃自治解放军从一次次战败中浴火重生——它是一个波兰人、俄罗斯人和哈萨克人建立的联盟，是将代表着疯狂与恐惧的帝国军队驱逐出哈萨克斯坦，并最终在废土上建立理想家园的最后希望。只要解放军尚存，被极端民族主义者和疯子所压迫的西哈萨克斯坦人民就有希望获救。库克林斯基的军队期待着一个更好的明天，将会继续解放他们的故土，坚持到最后一兵一卒。"
 TMQ_bitter_survivors: "苦涩的幸存者"
 TMQ_bitter_survivors_desc: "草原上的人民曾被沙皇迫害，又遭摄政灭绝，他们人口锐减，经历的苦痛不计其数。伊德尔-乌拉尔自由邦的人们，在苦涩中拿起长枪短铳，手持战斧，将会忍辱负重，坚持斗争，不再相信那些与塔博里茨基的恐怖政权合作的人。每一个大俄罗斯主义者都是自由地区政府重点关照的对象：虽然他们可能没有犯下罪行，但一次次给少数民族降下灭顶之灾的，就是这些大俄罗斯主义者，谁又能保证他们日后会不会又和其他压迫者合作呢？"
 TMU_horsemans_ride: "骑手的驰骋"
 TMU_horsemans_ride_desc: "叶夫图科维奇并不想在伊德尔-乌拉尔自由地区的土地上再重建什么，他也不想要帝国卫队元帅的以外的其他职称。他的任务只有一个：用火焰、毒气和子弹清洗反叛的草原人民。这也是叶夫图科维奇为了效忠蒙上帝洪恩的摄政和帝国而要做的事。为了能在喀山的废墟之上再次升起帝国国旗，他将不择手段，让分裂主义者和次等人种血溅四方都不过是“举手之劳”罢了。"
 TMN_new_land_of_iron: "涅槃的钢铁之地"
 TMN_new_land_of_iron_desc: "昔日的奥伦堡公社未能守护她的人民，在塔博里茨基政权的癫狂统治下，奥伦堡失去了仅存的自由。面对帝国卷土重来的危机，愈发激进的奥伦堡民众团结在秋明党组织的领导下在别尔乌辛的领导下，奥伦堡正转变为一座钢铁与工业铸就的城市，将一切可能的资源投入到国家的复兴上。"
 TMN_last_revolution: "最后的革命"
 TMN_last_revolution_desc: "别尔乌辛的革命影响深远——也很难说令人愉快。革命热情再次笼罩着奥伦堡的大地，人民积极地审讯叛国者，哪怕是一点点不利于他们邻居的证据，也会成为革命法庭上的黑材料。对向往永恒革命的新公社而言，反动分子不值得怜悯。"
 TMP_eye_for_an_eye: "以眼还眼"
 TMP_eye_for_an_eye_desc: "历史将重复其本身，第一次总是悲剧，而第二次依然是悲剧。俄罗斯人像宰牲口一样屠杀我们的同胞，还用他们肮脏的基因污染我们的血脉，我们的民族已经走到了灭绝的边缘。必须要把俄罗斯人碾为齑粉，吹散于草原凛冽的风雪之中，只有这样，我们的草原才能迎来和平。"
 TMG_the_pretender_of_the_people: "人民的冒牌皇帝"
 TMG_the_pretender_of_the_people_desc: "俄罗斯再一次陷入动乱与分裂中，如同曾经的伪德米特里一世一般，又一名冒牌皇帝登上了宝座。虽称作帝国，但在废土之上，阿列克谢维持着一个奇怪、隔绝、稳定且日渐强大的帝国。他反对摄政的种族理论，转而实行彼得大帝和叶卡捷琳娜二世的理念：阿列克谢的开明专制，使得他或许是新一轮的无政府动荡中尚存的理智统治者之一。"
 TMG_a_red_tsar: "红色沙皇？"
 TMG_a_red_tsar_desc: "虽然阿列克谢二世的身世不为他的人民所知，但实际上，他曾是一名NKVD特工、苏联官员。虽然阿列克谢自己的意识形态与亚戈达的布尔什维主义相去甚远，但他必须小心，不能去打破自己用激进的改革所创造出的谎言——人民必须对沙皇有信心，而不是已故的意识形态。"
 TMY_all_alone: "举目无援"
 TMY_all_alone_desc: "在四周反塔博里茨基政权的仇视之中，在远离俄罗斯心脏地带的远东僻壤，徘徊于绝望与自大之间的季基自封为“受祝摄政”。此地已经是俄罗斯纳粹主义在远东的最后堡垒，就连季基的臣民都对他脆弱且凄惨的统治深表同情。不过，这至少给了他一点小小的安慰。"
 TMR_critical_supply_shortage: "缺衣少食"
 TMR_critical_supply_shortage_desc: "尽管索布恰克尽了最大的努力，但要喂饱的嘴巴实在太多，粮食又太少。天寒地冻中，饥饿的人们逐个死去，取而代之的是更多的难民。外援是唯一可能的解决办法，但在外援到来之前，他们必须充分利用手头的一切。"
 TMM_shiver_my_soul: "寒彻入骨"
 TMM_shiver_my_soul_desc: "由于缺少不冻港，在东西伯利亚航行对于任何舰队来说都是件难事。光严苛的环境就能让最坚韧的水手离开这里，寻找更好的地方。然而，只要有堪比寒风和海浪的渴望，进取且无情的船长都会继续在极圈海域内航行，寻找商机。"
 TMM_greed_and_felony: "贪残无厌，目无法纪"
 TMM_greed_and_felony_desc: "走私是阿布拉莫夫的首要业务，毕竟当海盗的风险太高，但这并不是说不当海盗了——恰恰相反，若是对做生意有好处，这位法西斯舰长会很乐于杀人越货。"
 TMC_a_light_from_the_east: "光自东来"
 TMC_a_light_from_the_east_desc: "在阿尔塔莫诺夫与西伯利亚联合救国委员会的口号和宣传下，西伯利亚人民产生一种奇怪的希望。在彼得罗巴甫洛夫斯克，充满了对美国狂热且过于理想的赞美，这个国家举国上下都准备着迎接美国的救赎。阿塔莫诺夫手下的许多人都知道，他的承诺可能终究是竹篮打水一场空——但同多年前的专制暴君和激进分子相比，一个光明未来的承诺意义非比寻常。"
 TMI_visionary_enclave: "远视主义飞地"
 TMI_visionary_enclave_desc: "研究所，一处为了以科学和理性来构建一个更美好的世界而建立的飞地。车里雅宾斯克的资源被重新整合利用，用于开发和制造产品，以回收废物，恢复文明的面貌。在所长卡尔达舍夫的领导下，研究所的研究重点是以化学方法改造俄罗斯被污染的土壤和水源——而且，作为俄罗斯最后一个科学家和远视者的集中地，研究所很可能是重建一个宜居俄罗斯的最后希望。"
 TMI_the_cutting_edge: "尖端技术"
 TMI_the_cutting_edge_desc: "虽然研究所的部队规模不大，但坐拥车里雅宾斯克的基础设施，意味着他们能够武装一支作战能力远超规模的部队。每位士兵都装备着研究所最先进的武器，以此保卫研究所，在面临威胁时绝不会坐以待毙。"
 TMX_Black_Bandits: "黑匪"
 TMX_Black_Bandits_desc: "一些不那么客气的观点把马赫诺在乌克兰的安那其地区描绘成了一座私人王国，由自称是解放者的暴徒和任人唯亲的强盗所统治。不管你是否同意这种说辞，把它套在米舒连科的新“自由社会”上肯定合适——不过他似乎并不关心别人的看法。"
 TMF_depleted_population: "人丁枯竭"
 TMF_depleted_population_desc: "涅涅茨从来不是什么人丁兴旺的土地，虽说邻近地区涌入的难民与游击队，缓解了摄政种族屠杀带来的伤亡，但自由军依旧人手不足。要不是那些幸存的自由飞行员，他们无力抵抗西方的空降匪徒。"
 TMD_sky_reavers: "空中掠夺者"
 TMD_sky_reavers_desc: "空降匪徒，是俄罗斯黑暗大地上的新型恐怖瘟疫。他们的直升机编队从天而降，快于陆地上的任何一种交通工具，能够让空降匪徒包围、劫掠、夷平任何他们盯上的孤立居民区，令他们的对手措手不及。仅靠几架四十年代的老旧飞机可不足以终结他们的恐怖统治。"
 TMT_memories_of_heroism: "英雄主义的记忆"
 TMT_memories_of_heroism_desc: "除了都是俄罗斯人，联邦成员的共同特点是他们的军事传统。内务人民委员会的钢铁意志，乌拉尔卫队的坚韧不拔与第三集团军的严明纪律，在他们心中根深蒂固。无论发生什么，这份精神都不会畏缩。"
 TMH_The_Practical_Kingdom: "实用主义王国"
 TMH_The_Practical_Kingdom_desc: "有时，阿尔泰王国一点也不像是一个王国。国王鲍里斯身为君主，却没有王座，没有城堡，常常几天或几周不戴王冠。尽管他对阿尔泰必需物资的注重挽救了宝贵的生命和资源，但他平平无奇的统治却带来了士气上的问题——当一个国家的领导人都畏于梦想之时，这个国家又该如何逐梦呢？"
 TMB_evil_unbound: "邪恶无羁"
 TMB_evil_unbound_desc: "只有坏到骨子里的党卫军才够格在残忍暴虐方面同阿巴顿的追随者相提并论。连环杀手和虚无主义恶棍是这个新社会中备受敬仰的精英，他们那老领导者对疯狂世界摄人心魂的狂言，为泯灭人性的罪行披上了宗教狂热的外衣。"
 TMB_deranged_cult: "疯狂邪教"
 TMB_deranged_cult_desc: "纵观世界历史，真正并纯粹崇拜恶魔的撒旦教，从来只是个边缘邪教。但时代变了，世界的轴线已经倾覆。虽然兄弟会的多数成员不过是普通的匪徒，但他们那疯狂领袖的思想意识正在向下弥散，虽然缓慢，但千真万确。终有一日，撒旦这个名字将在整个鄂木斯克被不带一丝嘲讽地赞颂。"
 TMO_insular_enclave: "隔绝孤岛"
 TMO_insular_enclave_desc: "拉扎连科坚信，只有出生并成长于黑色联盟境内的人才是真正的俄罗斯人。因此，他们严密监视着人口，见到难民便恐吓或射杀，并残酷地奴役他们所占有的任何群体，而非促进融合。他们的人口稀少，而且会一直这样，但他们每一位成员都是狂热的献身者，为了伟大事业无惧于献出生命。"
 TMO_redemptionary_service: "救赎之役"
 TMO_redemptionary_service_desc: "虽然黑色联盟的指挥官认为，只有出生并成长于黑色联盟境内的人才真正有资格成为黑色联盟成员，但残酷的救赎旅仍是获得最基本权利的一种途径。通过在救赎旅中服役多年，一个人如果能活下来的话，他就可能最终获得黑色联盟成员资格，并获得黑色联盟的信任。"

An amusing thought, on some level.\n\nStill, he wasn't going to live forever. The empire was on the way out already - he wouldn't last much longer than it, that was certain. He needed a worthy successor, someone hand-picked to avoid another incompetent like Larionov taking charge. Security had to be attended to, as well. Defending the sovereignty of the Imperial Corporations took precedence over attachment to a dying nation.\n\nFirst, however, he'd need to set about carefully severing the tendons that tied his grand enterprise to the gangrenous body.

After seizing an imperial arsenal, they'd brought dynamite to the governor's palace, not bothering to clean the corpses of the soldiers who had died defending this... nightmare. Baganov surveyed the dynamite as it was placed, making sure to step over the pile of gore that had once been the governor. Ripped limb from limb, he remembered the screams. The bastard deserved worse, he thought. They all did. In a lapse of anger he kicked the mangled head of the governor across the hallway. He calmed down immediately, looking around at soldiers wondering what had happened, swiftly returning to their work. He'd have to be calm, but how could he be calm? Here, in this swastika-adorned Hell, a double-headed eagle glaring down on him?\n\nAs he was satisfied with the explosive placement, he shouted for the soldiers to leave. Once they had, they were met by a crowd of shivering, starving survivors, waiting to see what was left of the palace - those parts they hadn't looted - blown to kingdom come. \"Do it,\" Baganov ordered as a soldier pushed the plunger. An explosion rocked the palace, bringing part of it crashing down as pieces of marble and wood flew into the sky, but the main structure remained intact. He sighed, watching the dust settle on the husk of the palace. That damned palace. Its blind eagles staring into a nightmare.\n\nPickaxes, axes, and torches were distributed to the crowd once more descending on the palace. The palace still stood and it must be torn down. The legacy of that madman, that arch-traitor, that Antichrist, had to be destroyed. He and so many others swung, cut, and burned, trying to demolish the gilded symbol of Russia's end, tearing it down brick by sordid, swastika-emblazoned brick. \"Fall, damn you, fall!\" Baganov muttered as he tore a stairwell to pieces. \"What will it take to destroy you?\""

With the breakdown of the power grid, only those buildings with generators could still provide heating. He didn't know how many had already frozen to death, how many would in the coming months.\n\nHis mind snapped back into focus as he faced the three Narodniks. \"Mr. President, are you alright?\" one asked.\n\n\"Hmm? Yes, I was just thinking of something. Please continue, Mr. Ivanov.\"\n\n\"The peasantry requires additional aid. With the destruction of Novosibirsk's factories in the past decades, we Narodniks represent the common people of the republic. You can go on about creating a Eurasian utopia all you want, but unless you can help the people you claim to support, your words mean nothing.\"\n\nBaganov grimaced. \"I assure you, sir, we are providing what we can. Supplies are low enough as it is, and we need everything we can to-\"\n\n\"Aren't you supposed to be helping the people?\" the ruddy-faced woman interrupted. \"Isn't that the point of your Interim Government? Mr. President, if you cannot promise us food and land, then give us democracy.\"\n\nBaganov stood up. \"I am doing everything I can. Do you know how many corpses I've seen? How many burned villages and desolated farms? The poisoned rivers? That's what being President means. And so long as our people are starving, so long as Taboritsky's remnants haunt the forests, none of us will be safe from death. That's the harsh truth. You want to help the people?

The Imperial Army had used the original town for artillery practice, leaving only ruins for the survivors. Most fled or died, but gradually a settlement formed. The old Red Army combat engineer remembered his orders from Novosibirsk: to try fixing the agricultural situation here.\n\n\"So, Captain Emekova,\" he asked as he dismounted the cart and fetched his supplies, \"How are you enjoying your first day as an army engineer?\"\n\n\"Funnily enough, not as grim as my civilian career,\" the younger woman replied. \"The company's better, you bathe more than those partisans.\"\n\nHe chuckled, and the two made their way to the gates of Barnaul, greeted by a party of farmers. The two made their way inside as their soldier escorts began distributing the rations they had brought as best they could. Yevgeniy began examining the irrigation structures the farmers had built as Kira examined the soil. Could be constructed better, he supposed, but it wasn't the main issue. He began taking notes as Kira approached. \"The water's contaminated, but not by much. Still, it's enough to make most agriculture here difficult.\"\n\nYevgeniy checked the map he'd brought and pointed west. \"The old warlord that used to be based here began working on a water treatment plant about three kilometers that way. Never completed, but we can salvage something, improvise a purifier for the farms here. Better than nothing.\" He slapped Kira's back as the two mounted their cart and began their salvage."

The Siberian winter and collapse of agricultural supply had taken its toll on the city, and President Baganov had ordered the army to begin cleaning up the bodies of those who had succumbed.\n\nThe homeless population was found slumped, frozen, in alleys and in ruined shops. She'd then had to go into homes to find those who'd frozen to death in their own beds, or taken a more merciful way out first. God help her if the dogs had gotten there first...\n\nAs she drank from her battered flask of vodka, she looked up at the ruined building in front of her. Above the doorway she made out the outline of three gears, a familiar symbol, but one she could not place. She stood up and found a placard covered in the snow. She picked it up, dusting off the snow, and made out a faded word on the battered placard: \"Progress.\"\n\nShe remembered it all at once; the Titan Corporation. The brains of the federation, the nerve center of the Falcon's attempt to forge his new Russia. She scoffed. In a past life, she had been a Narodnik, one of those who kept the promise of a Russia that worked for all the people alive. Titan, Sibir, Feniks, all their supporters, what did they know of \"progress?\" What had their progress done for the people?\n\nBut in spite of everything, she felt... sorrow? Did she miss them? Yes, she concluded. They were bastards to a man, but they believed in progress, in a strong Russia, in a land where at the very least slaves wouldn't be forced into backbreaking shifts for the glory of a dead princeling, or where she wouldn't have to throw frozen corpses onto pyres because they couldn't dig enough graves. She sighed and took another swig. Titan's progress had lost, to the madness of what used to be Russia. She threw the placard to the side as she returned to work."

Shattered pieces of column and tattered posters alike litter the space that once housed the most honorable democracy in all of Russia. The former republic, the bearer of ancient virtue, was set ablaze by Taboritsky's madmen. Now the abominable two-headed eagle had fallen into desolation itself, and Zinoviev had nowhere else to turn to.\n\nZinoviev picked up a fraction of displaced marble and examined the Russian engravings, the whispers of democracy from before the wasteland. If any scholar could get a bird's-eye view of the ruin, he surely would have thought it belonged to a plaza from ancient Greece, not some pulverized remains of a recent Russian government. Zinoviev remembered how the Republic of Tomsk took its virtues from the ancient Greeks: sociability, conscience, benevolence, industriousness, to name a few. By comparison, Taboritsky's regime was only vice.\n\nIt wasn't long ago that Zinoviev was standing right here, side-by-side with Likhachyov, Shostakovitch, Kharms, and Sakharov in the glorious Duma, campaigning for the future of Russian progress. Now, he was the last one standing; the dying fate of Tomsk now rests in his hands alone. Taboritsky's men tried to douse the flame of Russia's last hope and nearly succeeded in purging the \"degenerate liberalism\" for good.\n\nThe last flicker in the torch sways side-to-side, unprotected from the raging wind. Tomsk has today to count and recover the dead lying in the wake of Taboritsky, but tomorrow, the city must rebuild. Democracy hangs by a struggling thread of hope in the middle of Siberia, but Zinoviev knows what he must do."

Discarded wood, piles of ash, and crumbled marble litter the landscape; of course, not one could forget the two or three charred bodies every 200 yards.\n\nDeep into the forest, a polished, rectangular wooden box rests among the teal grass and the black dirt. A closer look reveals inhuman claw marks along the top half of the box; whoever found this box before had pried it open violently. The leader of the group slowly and easily lifts the opening of the box, revealing the looted corpse of Boris Pasternak, the founder of the republic. All of his valuables were taken from him, but his body remains in one piece, much to the group's surprise. The scavengers pick up the coffin at once and return home.\n\nThe remnants of the Duma are delighted to see Pasternak's body recovered and in good condition. The older members recall how Pasternak fought tooth and nail to maintain his sacred democracy against all opposition. Younger members recall stories of Pasternak's fervent determination to see Tomsk thrive as he worked until his last breath. The Decembrists take pride in knowing that Pasternak was one of their own, and they vigorously insist that Pasternak be given a proper reburial.\n\nThe shining white sun begins to set, illuminating the bright green grass. The Decembrists gather on a large hill overlooking the River Ob, each one holding onto Pasternak's polished coffin. Dark green trees reflect against the sparkling river as the sun grows dimmer. The Decembrists bow their heads in one final moment of silence dedicated to the great founder, he who worked tirelessly to preserve the Russian dream. The body is laid to rest.

Those few who remain of the Humanist faction have made it their duty to identify every soul silenced by the reign of the Mad Regent, and to give them what little dignity could be afforded to them. It is far easier said than done - most bodies are already in advanced stages of decay, many have been damaged beyond recognition, and often there isn't even a next of kin left alive to make a final confirmation. Yet the tired, broken men and women who had once dreamed of a better world toil on.\n\nWhat few bodies that can be clearly identified are turned over to their families, if any still live. In many cases, the workers only have anecdotes and what few records had escaped the fires of the Regency to make an educated guess. It isn't unheard of for two separate bodies to be attributed to the same person. The Humanists give it their all, but in the end there are still so many bodies unaccounted for.\n\nWhen the task is done, they begin to dig. A section on the edge of the ruins of Tomsk is turned into a mass grave for all those who could not be identified. Upon the site, the Humanists erect a monument to the unknown soldiers and innocents, crafted from the rubble and detritus of the broken city. It bears a message of mourning, and a hope that such a tragedy might never be unleashed again. As the men and women stand solemnly around their last great work, a bitter finality sets upon them.

Almost all of the old records had been destroyed, and only a small portion of its equipment still functioned. One of the old technicians sits cradling the remains of his facility's pet cat for several hours. Eventually, the men and women of science realize that the time for mourning will not last forever, and soon they will need to salvage what they can of their old lives.\n\nWith the husk of the Academy as their base of operations, the most skilled surviving engineers of the Modernists set out to bring back some semblance of order to the land. The old politics of the city are now irrelevant and the other factions are busy with their own priorities, so the Modernists mostly go where they please. Soon, some limited amenities at the Academy and in the surrounding area are restored, but without reliable power and water supply there is little more they can do.\n\nSo, their attention turns towards the power plant. The nucleus of the old city, it had been bombed harshly during the Regent's march. The materials needed to repair it are scarce, but the power it could provide is too crucial to pass up. Slowly, the engineers got to work. Without proper equipment the work is gruelling, even deadly in some places - several die to electrocution, falling debris, and other accidents - but still they toil.\n\nFinally, with some trepidation, the Modernists activate the main generator, and cheer as it sputters into life. They know that many tasks still lay ahead; restoring the infrastructure needed to supply the power to the city will be a herculean task in itself. For now, however, they are content with the small victories. Amidst the desolation of the new Russia, they have found the light."

While the other factions trifle over the ruins of their old dreams, the Bastilliards turn to the wellbeing of the people. Under the leadership of Zinoviev, they establish kitchens and makeshift clinics amidst the ruins of the old city, even going so far as to reach out into the surrounding villages and towns. They do what they can to tend to the basic needs of the people, with what little food and medicine remains.\n\nThe kitchens are a microcosm of the new Russia. Broken men, dead-eyed women, starving children, all come to be fed and treated as best as the Bastilliards can manage.

The damage caused by the reign of terror lingers in the mind as well as in the physical world, but under the care of Zinoviev's men the people can find some semblance of healing.\n\nIn the old Tomsk, the Bastilliards were often regarded as the coldest of the factions, caring more about the strength and sanctity of Russia than the people who lived within it.

A mass movement's character is that of the average of its people, shared sentiments coalescing into one single fist.

The average had changed, a dark drop of corruption had fell in the pool of human sentiment, and that mass fist became one, perhaps not if of malice, of pain.\n\nWeapons sprung from the floorboards, having been waiting for the Day of Freedom. Bullets sprang through the streets, and the imperials were gunned down, then gunned down more, and, for good measure, filled with more rounds. Were it not for that the fact that they had already been twisted down to the soul, the bodies would have been unrecognizable.\n\nThe trees rang with cries and screams, but not many cheers.

 after_midnight.31.d: "The hooves of horses sloshed through muddy grass as the first rays of the sun dissipated the mist that had gathered over the land. The air was silent, broken only by the sound of horses and quiet sobs as the small group of captives stood shivering and silent, awaiting their fate.\n\nThey were once part of the imperial regime. Portly bureaucrats, priests in tattered robes, soldiers with faded patches of the Holy Russian Empire, and even the wife of one of the Mad Regent's governors. People who had enabled the tyranny of a madman. Now there was no Regent to protect them. Now there was only judgement. Only justice.\n\nFrom atop his steed, Androniy Mishurenko motioned, and two of the Black Army soldiers cut the captives free. They stood there, frozen. Mishurenko met the eyes of one of the captives, a women. He smiled coldly. \"Run.\" She remained frozen. Another gesture, and a gunshot sounded, and one of the captives fell dead. That spurred the remaining ones into action, even starved and beaten as they were, their pain was forgotten as adrenaline and terror filled them.\n\nThe soldiers mounted their steeds, chuckling in amusement and jeering at the fleeing captives, watching them scurry like rats in a desperate bid to save their lives. A mere execution for these imperials was too clean. They deserved worse. They deserved to feel a fraction of the fear they had inspired in the name of their Regent. They deserved to suffer, as Russia had. Their last moments would be ones of abject terror, of pain, of suffering as the Black Army extracted justice long overdue.\n\nThe charade had lasted long enough. Putting two fingers to his lips, he whistled, and the soldiers cheered and kicked their horses into action and their bloodlust took over. As Mishurenko led the charge, he savored the terror of the imperials, moments before they were trampled under the steeds of the reborn Black Army."

The cheering grew louder and the man was unable to stop the barrage of blows, and he collapsed to the ground, unconscious as the audience beat their drinks against the table and roared loud enough to wake the town at the sight of the champion.\n\nMore drinks of sloshing brown and frothy beer were brought out by women who'd once managed what had once been the home of the Bratsk governor, directly from the basement distillery. More brawls and fighting rings were springing up, a particularly large one between two of the few women who remained with the true Black Army.\n\nAs Mishurenko walked through the manor, he shook his head at the men knocked out on the floor or slumped against the wall. Poorly fared the man in this place who could not hold his drink or fists well. Ah well, such was the freedom the Black Army embodied. No greater was such ideals represented than in this place. Inheritance claimed through conquest, and now rightfully belonged to them.\n\nThis place which had once stood to embody the passive horror of the Mad Regent's bureaucracy now stood ransacked. The fine furniture torn up and stained, smelling of beer. The fancy rugs burned or sold. Portraits of Taboritsky placed in corners where men pissed on them to the cheers of their drunken brethren.\n\nA fitting end for this monument to imperial statism - or something like that. Perhaps this revelry he witnessed was not in the true spirit of anarchism, yet to Mishurenko's mind, only sniveling puritans like Taratuta would look upon this expression of freedom, and condemn it. After all, what was anarchism if not the freedom to eat, drink, revel, and celebrate where one wished?"

This was not his job - he had been pulled from a random tent to draft a letter to Taratuta, a manifestation of a random thought from Mishurenko after a night of binging and drinking. As Mishurenko finally finished his slurred, loud oration, he swung his head to the stenographer and asked him to read out loud. The stenographer began:\n\n\"To the traitorous bitch-dog known as Taratuta, be prepared to understand your weakness!\n\nWe require no account other than our own eyes, for we have seen a whore rape her nation and claim it peace! We have watched as your cuckolded pawns live in squalor, as you let them wallow in shit and wallow in it yourself! Watch, Taratuta, as a million impure savages lick their lips, as they think of ways to fuck your nation. Without the watchful eye of the Black Army, there is no hope for the good people of Siberia, as they are trapped in a rancid carcass as it swarms with flies.\n\nHave you provided freedom and prosperity to your peasants? No! Those who have turned away from Androniy Mishurenko, the true liberator of the peasants and workers, are now as impoverished and sullen as the common bitch. Those within Mishurenko's vast lands weep, as they watch you fuck their daughters and mothers. How do you not stain your vast, piggish face with tears at the plight of your own nation? So long as you breathe, you are a sore on the ass of every Russian peasant. May the Black Army liberate every oppressed Russian, and may the liberated Russian piss upon your corpse!\"\n\nThe room turned to Mishurenko to wait for a response..."

He had furiously tried to move to stop them, only to freeze in fear when one of them lazily aimed his weapon in his direction.\n\n\"What do you think you're doing, comrade?\" The Black Army soldier asked with a lazy, knowing smile that was missing several teeth. His ugly face was pinched and greasy as dirty fingers rested on the trigger. \"You wouldn't be interrupting an official Black Army inspection, would you?\"\n\n\"You're robbing me!\" Yuri shouted.\n\nThe soldier exchanged a glance with his partner before they both laughed. \"No, no, comrade,\" the soldier said in between mocking chuckles. \"Not robbing. Inspecting. And it just so happens this is the monthly taxation period,\" he frowned mockingly. \"Or is weekly? Ah, doesn't matter, does it?\" Both men found their inside joke more funny than Yuri, who could only stand there in silent fury and fear, as he knew that there was nothing he could do.\n\n\"The Black Army appreciates your contribution, comrade,\" the soldier said mockingly, as he grabbed an unopened beer bottle on his way out. \"Oh, that is a fine horse you have out front. Don't worry, we'll take good care of her.\" With a lazy wave, both of the Black Army bandits left the house they'd ransacked and ruined, barely keeping their amusement at their grand theft to themselves. Yuri knew that what they were stealing wasn't going anywhere but their own pockets.\n\nHe felt sick. He remembered a time when the Black Army had once protected them. Had once stood for something.

In this land of misery and suffering, were they not still the shining beacon of liberty in Siberia?\n\nHow could they not be? Mishurenko knew they had what was essential to liberty - freedom. True freedom, in a way the previous \"Free\" Territory had never possessed. The cowards and traitors under Taratuta called him a dictator, yet how could he be a dictator when he had the complete loyalty of his men? Jealousy, that was all it was, they saw the riches his men plundered, the endless stores of food and drink they enjoyed, and they stewed in anger at the sight of the true freedom his Black Army enjoyed. The Black Army, who was returning justice to the Siberian lands one dead imperial at a time - along with anyone else foolish enough to stand in their way.\n\n\"Comrades!\" He rode his horse up and down the lines of soldiers who stood attentively, with hunger in their eyes, and bloodlust in their hearts. \"Beyond us stands oppression! Tyranny! And traitors to the Black Army!\" The soldiers roared and boo'd the mention of Taratuta's rival state, as Mishurenko lifted a hand, and silence once more fell. \"We have brought this land under our protection, but we will not abandon those beyond it to suffer under the hand of tyrants and traitors!\"\n\nHe swung an arm outstretched to the greater Siberian lands. \"We are the singular beacon of freedom in Siberia! It is time to bring liberty, peace, and justice once more to the Motherland!\" The ground shook from the cheers and roars of the army before him, and Mishurenko's heart soared as he fed upon the energy displayed. \"Ready your arms, my brothers!\" Mishurenko declared to deafening cheers, as rifles were raised into the air. \"Our crusade of liberty begins today!\""

Like after dealing with a rat infestation, one still flinches at every sound from behind the walls or beneath the floorboards.\n\nAnd yet there was another parasitic infestation to deal with.\n\n\"Men, followers of the tsar, keepers of Holy Russia!\" his voice boomed through the hall, staring over the small throng of officers and bureaucrats watching him. Even at their highest attendance, they could barely fill a third of the seats. \"We have been betrayed! The lying Jew Larionov didn't even wait for our Blessed Regent's body to cool before trying to seize power for himself! He seeks to keep the Tsarevich hidden, no doubt so the Polack to our west can join forces with him!

Thankfully, I have told the Shturmoviki to deal with them!\"\n\nOn cue, Shturmoviki stepped forward from the wings and started grabbing men in the audience, dragging them to a fate nobody had to guess. At first, the targets seemed obvious; rivals for regional power, pragmatic collaborators who lacked ideological loyalty, suspected crypto-Jews, and the like. Then they started grabbing others, those who as far as anybody knew had done nothing wrong or disloyal. One stood up and proclaimed \"God save Alexei, the tsar who shall be, and God bless his holy regent!\" Others joined in, alternating between \"Praise Alexei!\" and \"Praise Dikiy!\" but it was futile at stopping some of them from being dragged away. Even some of the Shturmoviki were suddenly arrested by their comrades.\n\nWhen it was all over, the numbers of the audience had been reduced by about half, and the remainder were giving a fervent standing ovation to Dikiy-almost as if their lives depended on it."

Man cannot live on bread alone, but an army cannot march on prayers to God alone either.\n\nHe took off his glasses and polished them before looking at the river again, as if it could somehow deliver a greater tranquility now that his vision was cleared. Nothing. Suddenly, Dikiy felt incredibly faint, and he staggered toward the armchair in the office's corner before he passed out completely.

Of course, as far as his men were concerned, he was valiantly conducting affairs of state and solving the problems that plague the regency. But frankly, it was getting hard to tell the difference between the problems and the state. Who was his friend anymore? Who was his enemy? Were his guards up to something? Why did demanding more guard rotations not solve that? Was the officer who planned the guard rotations in on it? What was he in on?\n\nDikiy glanced at the wall, showing a map of Russia, endless lines drawn on it in half a dozen colors showing the ever-shifting borders of the state. That was it! With Russia so divided, he could simply wage wars and keep the guards he distrusted on the front lines at all times! It was genius, why didn't he think of that before?\n\nHe returned to his desk and began feverishly writing, composing battle strategies, drafting mobilization orders, all the energy of a man possessed.

The meeting did not go well. The American had neglected to mention beforehand that he wanted cold, hard cash in exchange for his help; cash that Sobchak did not have.\n\nAfter some vague promises were made, a deflated Sobchak then looped back to the ruins of Zeya to inspect one of the last remaining armaments industries still in operation. \"In operation\" turned out to be a generous way of putting it indeed, as the factory had a shortage of workers, working equipment, and electricity. It seemed his militia would have to go even further without even the bare minimum of equipment.\n\nA long day had passed, and Sobchak was not sure he had accomplished anything at all. As he crawled into bed that cold and lonely night, dark thoughts began to creep into places once occupied by cautious optimism.

Sobchak didn't know what had become of Mikhail after they had fled Russia, but he had assumed that this time the former tsar had given up on Russia for good.\n\nSobchak folded the letter and stashed it in his coat pocket, focusing his attention to the tons of Australian grain being hauled off a ship for transport. If not from Mikhail himself, someone sympathetic to his cause certainly still had a vested interest in Russia.

As he approached the scene, he was greeted by a rather familiar elderly officer. \"Anatoly Aleksandrovich, I appreciate you coming here on such short notice.\"\n\n\"It's no trouble at all, Nikolay.\" Sobchak looked over Kossov's shoulder to see a group of foreigners being aggressively questioned by his guards. \"What am I looking at here, exactly? Who are these men?\"\n\nKossov glanced at the scene behind him before turning back to Sobchak. \"We caught these Japanese fellows trying to sneak in by boat. They claim to be here on a humanitarian mission, but my men think they might be here for a different reason.\"\n\nSobchak sighed. \"Tell your men to let them go. Japan has no reason to be spying on us, they've got bigger fish to fry than some naive fools in the middle of Siberia.\"\n\n\"Are you certain, Anatoly? I've spent enough time down south to know that Japan never extends their hand for free. You wish to take that risk?\"\n\n\"For Christ's sake, Nikolay, let them go. Have you forgotten we're still standing waist-deep in shit? I'm not about to turn away help on the off chance there might be strings attached. Do you even know if they're here on behalf of Japan at all?\"\n\nKossov nodded without another word, and with a call to his men, the aid workers were allowed to continue their mission; as Sobchak had guessed, it was apparently one of genuine altruism, rather than the quid-pro-quo they were suspected of."

The question was not entirely unfamiliar to Artyom, of course, for he had once asked the same thing of his own father nearly fifty years ago.\n\nThe year was 1921, and the Bolsheviks were in the ascendant. Artyom, a child at the time, was forced to flee his homeland towards safer shores. His days spent in Russia at the time had been nothing if not pleasant, safely growing up in the lap of luxury thanks to his family's wealth. Of course, it was this wealth that had painted a giant crosshair over each and every member of the Valentinov clan, necessitating their escape from the only home they ever knew.\n\nHis father's answer, of course, was yes. After many years spent hiding away in Canada, his promise came true nearly three decades later: when the White Army emerged from hibernation in Harbin to carry on the old fight once again. The Valentinovs would be among the first to return to Russia to aid them however they could.\n\nWhen they had first arrived, they had numbered over a dozen: including Artyom, his wife, and his four sons. Now, only two of this illustrious clan remained; slowly whittled away by the horrors that would blow in from the West like a terrible storm. When Artyom had left Russia, he did so with a homesickness in his heart, but he knew that it was an entirely different story with his son. He had survived, but not without bearing witness to the very worst that humankind had to offer.\n\n\"Father?\" His son's voice brought him back to the present.

 after_midnight.51.d: "Turbulent waves of seawater crashed upon the rugged and precipitous rocks of the shore, seeping into the small, porous holes present within the sides of the old wharves and docks, protruding into the tempestuous open waters of the Sea of Okhotsk.\n\nNikolai Abramov observed the everyday nature of the port from within a modest office, overlooking a remarkable jewel of the Siberian coast: Magadan, humbled only in the Far East by Vladivostok itself. Abramov sat himself down before an aged wooden desk, littered with nautical maps and shipping records, clasping his hands together as he reviewed them with attentiveness. He had once pledged his skills and seamanship to the cause of the Russian Fascist Party, sailing under the banners of national socialism and the swastika. What naive fools they were, relentlessly pursuing empty ideological principles and dogma set in place by distant and bygone men, blinding them from their necessary duties; the two separate branches claimed to be different, yet Abramov held no loyalty to either.\n\nReminiscing about the past is pointless now, he thought. The Russian Fascist Party had ceased to exist long ago, their actions and deeds relegated to the annals of history, but he was still here. Abramov fixed his mind upon present matters; opening a drawer, he placed a map of the region squarely in front of himself, marked with common shipping routes. As he observed the map, he began theorizing about overlooked portions of the ocean where his smuggled cargo could slip past unnoticed from the prying eyes of foreign patrol ships, and which routes would net the most substantial profits.\n\nA series of vessels departed from Magadan's shores, brimming with illicit goods, bound for locations across the seas. Regardless of where they are headed, they will all return to the same place: the port nestled upon the frigid coastline of the Far East."

A ship could be seen in the distance, its hull adorned with a stripe of dark crimson; despite the fact that dozens of vessels of the same size pass by the icy port to participate in its clandestine operations every day, this ship, in particular, attracted the fixated attention of crowds of sailors and dock workers. Once the ship was in port, the reason for its allure was quickly revealed as the crew unloaded crate after crate of sweet and fragrant alcohol.\n\nTo Nikolai Abramov, the appeal of indulging in alcoholic beverages is something he was all too familiar with. It was a craving that needed to be satiated once in a while, and it brought forth the ecstasy and bliss of temporarily losing awareness of one's abundance of problems and responsibilities; in the current desperate state of affairs, the elevated demand was self-explanatory.\n\nAn abundance of vodka and gin in Magadan itself would certainly be of benefit, Abramov thought. He was aware of the lucrative financial prospects it could bring to the territory, as alcohol was desired in markets all around the world. A single yet crucial issue, however, existed: the acquisition of such goods would prove to be a substantial challenge, as shipping routes for alcohol did not usually cross into the waters of the Sea of Okhotsk. As Abramov continued to deliberate, a thought popped into his mind: piracy. Although he did not have the adequate manpower or equipment necessary for direct involvement, he possessed valuable contacts in the South China Sea, contacts who would gladly divert Japanese alcohol shipments to the north, for a price.\n\nAbramov smiled as he reached for the half-empty bottle of vodka beside his desk, a rarity soon to be plentiful in the frozen northern port."

In the distance, the distinctive shape of a vessel could be seen from the coastline, drifting slowly towards the horizon.\n\nThe unremarkable ship, though nominally transporting a shipment of coal, ferried dozens of men, women, and children; people who wished to begin anew in shores of greater opportunity and stability, people who wished to abandon their dreadful livelihoods in the derelict remnants of a land once called Russia. The atmosphere aboard the ship was one of euphoria and exhilaration; the open decks were brimming with elated men, bottles of vodka in hand, celebrating their progression into a future of hope and optimism. The vivacious and ebullient cheers of ecstasy were interrupted as a deafening crash could be heard from the decks below, the vessel began to tilt gradually as a deluge of frigid seawater poured into the hull with the force of a tempestuous maelstrom, slowly weighing down what had become an iron sarcophagus. The enthusiastic and merry atmosphere of the passengers had dissipated, replaced with expressions of horror and cries of fear as the tumultuous ocean slowly devoured part after part of the ship, forcing the people aboard to resort to increasingly futile attempts at survival, unwilling to accept fate.\n\nNikolai Abramov watched from a distance, his facial expression was one of indifference, having no remorse over what he considered was just. The ship had refused to pay the full amount required for docking and had exited the port, there had to be measures of retaliation, for they must set a clear precedent. Three red flares shot up into the evening sky, a last, desperate plea for rescue; a plea that would never be answered."

He sighed in exasperation as grim thoughts of distress flooded his mind, overwhelming him with dread as he remembered the dire straits they were currently in. He calmed himself down with the last tool still present within his mental arsenal: hope. Hope that the future would not be as forlorn as today; hope that he may return one day to a recovered and united homeland; hope that even as the ships he possessed were paltry in comparison to the mighty vessels of decades past, he would still be able to sail towards the horizon in triumph, smiling with glee.\n\nThe deafening sound of a ship's horn scattered Leonid's thoughts and pulled him back into reality. One of his men pointed towards a strange, foreign ship approaching the modest flotilla. The words \"Free Marine Infantry\" were inscribed onto the side of the ship, confusing Leonid as the men made contact. Soon, a small party appeared before Leonid and began reciting demands in an emotionless tone, calling for him to surrender his ship. Leonid was taken aback by the bluntness of their words, but knew that he was not in a position to negotiate as made evident by the weapons being brandished by several of the men. He deliberated for a short while before deciding to flatly decline; he had sacrificed too much and toiled for too long to simply abandon everything. No, he would resist.\n\nBefore the words of disapproval left his mouth, he collapsed onto the deck, a pool of blood gathered around his head."

Its craftsmanship was of Manchurian origin, its modest anchor submerged into the frozen depths, lodging itself neatly between rugged underwater rocks. A Chinese man stood on the edge of the stern, his hands clenching a mechanical lever, used to retrieve the net. As he let out a sigh of fatigue and began pulling, he failed to notice the approaching ship; a vessel slightly larger and bulkier than his own, commandeered by men dressed in drab, threadbare woolen uniforms. Before a single word of protest could be uttered, one of the men jumped onto the boat and proceeded to ferociously pummel the fisherman with exceeding force using a rubber cudgel before dragging him, blood-soaked, aboard. The man's ship was seized and taken to the hub of illicit activity that was Magadan, to be sold for a pretty penny at the smuggling market.\n\nAbramov sat squarely before his desk as he sifted through various reports from differing regions and times; sightings of sizable ships with hefty steel hulls, bearing the colors of Manchukuo, armed with imposing guns of different calibers. He slammed his fist onto the wooden table as he continued to contemplate his options; would the self-indulgent Japanese lords to the south truly bother with such trivial affairs as the deprivation of a handful of Chinese fishermen, to the point where they would expend resources to infringe upon sovereign waters? As thoughts raced across his mind, he readjusted his thinking; regardless of whether the specific reports were factual, it certainly would be reasonable to suggest Japanese interference in the Sea of Okhotsk, and as long as there is a slim possibility, his craft would be at stake.\n\nAbramov peered out towards the docks and harbors below, brimming with workers loading and unloading crates upon crates of smuggled cargo; then towards the vast and boundless ocean, stretching for uncountable miles, extending into the horizon.

At last, the tensions dissipated as the brilliant light of a lighthouse - clearly makeshift, but serviceable enough and certainly a sight for sore eyes - guided them to the destination they had been searching for. Awaiting them was a large, but crude harbour, likely built recently for the specific purpose of receiving aid, such as that carried by the American ship. As they pulled into that harbour, a crowd of Russians, looking largely malnourished but no less jubilant for it, cheered for them. \"Come on John, let's not keep them waiting.\" One sailor called out to another, as the ship anchored. At the sight of the absolute gratitude of the people before them, all the irritations and tensions of the sailors were forgotten, replaced by an earnest and genuine desire to help them survive, and rebuild their lives."

She was an old model, a transport ship from some forgotten convoy, bruised from 20 years of hard work and rusted from 30 years of abandonment in a Far Eastern harbor. Her floorboards cracked with every malicious crash of a wave against her hull, and new leaks let loose their payload of freezing water at the cue of the metallic, screeching sounds of plating tearing.\n\nThe wind howled, laced with razorblade sleet, around the Captain's reddening and frostbitten ears as he shouted orders over the roaring of the tides and the deathrattle of his craft. It was too late, of course, but Ivan was never a man to give up on his word - he was going to bring him, his family, and the rest of the refugees to Alaska or die in the heart of the sea. Dying at sea was a blessing compared to what would be in store for them back home.\n\nWith another roar of splitting steel, the ship began to sink rapidly. Ice cold water was lapping its way over the deck, and the crew and passengers atop it were already beginning to tumble into the frothing mouth of the Arctic off the steepening slope of the deck. The ones below... Ivan chose not to think about what had happened to them. Taking in one last shaky breath, he put on a stiff upper lip, and allowed himself to keep the latter half of his promise. The St. Niphon was dragged under, and at last her cries of pain ended along with her crew's.\n\nThe Orthodox graveyard outside of Anchorage was grimly silent under the cold sun. It was empty but for a priest and a single journalist. Four blank gravestones marked the final resting place of the sailors who had been found. The priest gave the four half-frozen men and women their last rites, and the journalist scribbled down yet another story of Russian corpses recovered on the beaches of Alaska."

With quality firewood increasingly scarce and highly priced after everything that had happened to the Russian landscape, coal had become truly invaluable as a cheap and relatively widely available heat source to the ordinary people of Kamchatka, and of what remained of Russia in general.\n\nThe sailors, as friendly as ever, even helped to unload the cargo themselves to lighten the load of the local people, despite the difficulty of communication between the two groups; in times like these, they reasoned, help should not have to be asked for to be received.

Here, the highest industrial authorities in the regency had convinced Taboritsky to allow for a sole concession: a single, massive skyscraper, stripped clean of the Regent's wasteful requirements and obsessions, a black tower dominating an ashen grey landscape. Taboritsky's only request, a metal sculpture of Tsar Alexei, was slowly being dismantled by construction crew as twelve limousines slipped through the gates and entered the monolith.\n\nIn the first hours of morning, a cabal of the regency's industrial leaders entered Meeting Room 25 in the top floor of the Kostroma office, flanked by a pair of guards and several emaciated servants. The bright light from the room's massive window was almost blinding against the dim light of the office interior. Through it, Consortium Chairman Nikolay Talberg appeared as a spectre, casting a long shadow onto the oblong table.\n\nTalberg began to speak with a quiet gravity that forced the consortium to take heed. \"Look out, beyond this window, and see what the Regent has given us. It approaches greatness...\" A legion of chairs began to turn, though no one said a word. \"Yet I see inefficiencies and errors, mistakes that allowed his dream to crumble. Mistakes that brought us here. Mistakes we shall not repeat.\"\n\nFrom behind the president's frail form, billows of smoke spilled from a thousand wicked smokestacks, as the Imperial Mercantile Consortium rose like a revenant from Russia's poisoned dirt."

This was the primary mission of Consortium diplomacy - a never-ending hunt for foreign companies, foreign machinery, foreign dollars. Yet plans for German investment died on the leaves as if one of Taboritsky's hideous vessels had flown overhead and smited the earth itself.\n\nIf only there were less ideologues on company boards, men who depended on feeble Untermenschen fears to sleep at night. Those men, the so-called thinkers of the boardroom, always balked at the Consortium. When they saw the pictures of the massive cathedrals, smeared with filth and packed with broken beings, they were afraid. Despite every inclination, their minds could not help but focus on the faces of the workers, smeared with sweat and grime, wincing in anguish or hanging in defeat. A face which could be German.\n\nAfter the slideshow, when the slim and upright Consortium representative walked to the head of the boardroom, the ideologues would silently beg for a justification, a reason, something to make it all okay. And the representative, unaware of this primal terror, would say nothing.\n\nBut occasionally, a man of action, of discipline, would stare at the production line and not see a line of broken figures, crackling and bending in endless toil. All he would focus on, all he could focus on, were the well made, well priced, products between their hands."

His body demanded sleep - he had been up for far too long for his age. But this would work. The chairman was certain of it.\n\nThis was the deal that the Consortium had been waiting for. Even a week ago, German investment seemed like a dream. Even Talberg was surprised when he heard a [Get_after_midnight_68_corporation] was interested in an offer. Now, two representatives sat in front of his desk, eyeing every detail and passing notes.\n\nTalberg raised his glass. \"A toast to industry,\" Talberg said, as his assistant poured his guests a drink. As crimson red flowed into two stained glasses, he thought in horror about just how rare wine of this quality had become after the Regent. The last good bottle of wine in Russia, poured into the mouths of German swine.\n\nFor a minute or so, the representatives chatted among themselves, grinning and pointing. Nikolay was certain they were laughing at him. He knew why they'd even attempt to make a deal, and it wasn't out of German kindness. It was violence. They were younger than him. Stronger than him. Bloodhounds on the hunt, ready to rip out his neck and bring the corpse to German masters.\n\nFinally, one spoke in broken Russian - \"This... good wine. May we see?\" Talberg handed over the bottle, frustrated but willing to put up with anything. It was a Zweigelt, imported from Austria some twenty years prior. The two paused. \"Aryan. Of course.

A decade ago they called them Untermensch - here, they called them restricted workers.\n\nToday, Donner hadn't brought his battalion. This was a private meeting, purely to discuss finances. From what Donner had heard, the Consortium was extremely generous. So long as they got what they needed, they'd give you what you wanted - no questions asked. A nice arrangement.\n\nDonner slowed his truck at the foot of the massive central station, and pulled a silver watch from his jacket. He was a bit early. Donner pulled a cigarette from his other pocket and began to smoke.\n\nA few minutes later, Donner noticed a pair of eyes staring back at him. A young, pale figure, with sunken eyes and a concave belly, had stopped his cart to observe this stranger. A younger Donner would've crushed him - now, it seemed barely worth the effort. The Waffen-SS had shown Donner every depravity he could try, and left him numb.\n\nAn intrusive thought reached Donner's mind - perhaps the slave felt the same. But this was impossible. The slave had not traveled the world. The slave had not felt the heat of the African jungle, or the glory of victory on the front line. The slave had done nothing, and was given nothing.

His current predicament certainly did not aid matters: the everyday administration of what little remained under his control was proving to be a gargantuan task.\n\nTaboritsky, may God have mercy on his soul, had left no instructions for a successive regent. Most days, Larionov found himself close to cursing some of the administrative decisions that his predecessor had made in the name of the Tsarevich. While they were assuredly decisions made for the benefit of Holy Russia, Larionov more often than not found himself putting out fires left over from the foibles of the previous administration.\n\nA sudden crash of thunder from outside the window of his bedchambers caused the aging man to jump to his feet in fright. With a muttered swear, he wobbled over to close the window that had been thrown open by the wind. Panting from the exertion of walking across the room, he slid down the wall, coming to a rest on the floor.\n\nA sudden idle fancy struck him: perhaps they would let him abdicate? It was clear that he was in over his head, surely the others could see that. He would simply retire from politics, and let someone more competent take up the reigns.\n\nHis sudden hopes were dashed as quickly as they had appeared. Of course they wouldn't just let him leave. He knew too much, had seen too much. No, it was much more likely that they would simply kill him for daring to admit that things were any less than perfect.

It was something he figured was good for morale, and he did truly care about them. The downside of course was that he rarely got to eat his food in peace.\n\n\"Andreev, you know what the Regent says about gossip,\" he responded. Andreev was a good boy, really. Earnest in a way that a lot of new recruits weren't, and halfway competent with a rifle. Valery had noticed a general decline in the competence of the new faces in his regiment. Some tried, and just couldn't hack it, though he could tell that many more were in it simply for a paycheck and a warm bed. He missed the old days, where they fought for the preservation of the Russian race.\n\nAndreev's face fell, flushing a bit at the chastisement. \"'Idle gossip is the tool of the devil,' I know, but this is too big not to tell,\" he said, \"Olev told me that he heard the entire outpost got wiped out by partisans.\"\n\n\"What?\" Valery asked, incredulity plain in his voice.\n\n\"It's true.

Letting out a soft groan, he stretched his arms, feeling each pop as his tired joints settled back into place. Antonin had recently started staying later at the office, helping the Regent with whatever he needed done. He was getting rather worried about Larionov, actually. The Regent had recently been overtaken by a palsy, his movements stiff and shaky, and day by day was growing into less of the person that Antonin had once so admired. More than once had he found the Blessed Regent wandering around his office, muttering confusedly to himself, and would need to be gently reminded as to what he was supposed to be doing at any given point in time.

The mottled apartment complexes gazed over the people eking out an existence, left to buckle and break under Taboritsky. Russia found itself content with its quiet despair, and found no reason to break out of it- the Shturmoviki made sure to maintain that apathy, and the people knew not to break from it. Russia waited. With every day spent waiting for change, Russia's will decayed, its spirit abolished in favor of heresy. Such was the fate of the people of Samara - victims to apathy, soldiers of sloth. Russian spirit was born anew, and in a sense, it repeated. When clergymen gave sermons to their people, the people listened - the word of the Lord had returned to Russia, expunged too long by insanity. When what few Catholics of Russia flocked to the city, apathy began its own death, its inevitable supernova showering the city in determination. When the people took up arms in the name of liberation, apathy's death was ensured, and the city was showered in fire and lead.\n\n\"Any word of the ROA?\" Vladkya Pimen shouted to nobody in particular, as he stood besides a field hospital consisting of those in Samara who knew to hide their talents, everyone working on a burn victim or shrapnel ridden partisan - shouted, as the gunfire crackling throughout main street had yet to dissipate. The Vyatkan officers and clergy members surrounding him made up what effectively amounted to an escort, as vengeful Shturmoviki prowled the alleyways and windows, prompting the guard to bring with them a dozen AT grenades. Down the street, a flare's light lit up a smokescreen, occasionally glowing with the harsh streaks of gunfire, and a figure growing clear from out of the smoke, bearing a bandaged arm, half-sprinting past the mortar teams taking position along the sides of the street. By the time he got to the escort, his arm had grown soaked through with blood, and he was panting like a beaten dog. \"Your Excellency-\" He took in a deep breath, then continued. \"The ROA remnant armies have been finishing off the remaining regency forces in the north of the city-\" he gestured towards the roof of an office block on the verge of collapsing with his good hand, as the thump of mortars flew over it, \"and we have reports of clergy arming slaves in Nizhny Novgorod.

Coffee ran out long ago, and his collection of teabags now rotting in his waste bin was allowing for a disgusting manifestation of his work ethic to take shape within the confinement of his trivial workspace. Outside, shouting matches had been taking place all day, night, and day, concerning what went where, and how much could be spared. From the sounds of it, nothing. From the looks of it, too. Foodstuffs hadn't exactly been plentiful prior to the takeover, and now they simply did not exist. So had his twenty Manila folders told him, anyways. Feeling around his pockets, Fredrik pulled out his last cigarette. Rolling it around in his fingers, he could tell the filter was liable to snap. Poor manufacturing skills, the cost of half your skilled workers being turned to brick-layers or corpses. The image of the uprising flashed to Fredrik's mind, prompting him to take out his match box.\n\nThat was better. Now, he could really think. Right; the problem was a total lack of infrastructure for essentials, and everyone was starving from their side of the Don to Nizhny Novgorod. If only everyone knew just how bad things were in this goddamned city. The tobacco and tea had mixed together into a vomit-inducing smell, certainly not helped by the figures sitting on the paper behind Fredrick, as he sat in front of his desk, and watched the smoke dissipate as the ceiling fan chopped it to pieces. This wasn't enough. Walking out the door, he left it open, half to air out the diseased waste bin, half to show his superiors he hadn't been sleeping, as if the smell wasn't enough an indicator. Stepping outside, the streets of Samara weren't actually crowded, not by his definition, but the signs of a city fit for starvation were everywhere. He let out a puff of smoke and stepped down from his office steps with an irrelevant urgency, as the reports he'd left unfinished in his office would need much more than the seconds he'd saved. As he walked, he checked his surroundings. He walked past a couple, thin as his pencils, and half as strong.

The hall the meeting was taking place in was a relic of Taboritsky's exploits, redecorated to abolish the vile memories of the unspeakably horrific character. The mural to the Tsarevich, a symbol of the horrific actions taken in his name, was repainted with the dull yellows and reds into a scene of the heavens, though with the scheme adorning the wall, it was hard to associate the scene with anything but the land below their feet. The swastikas hanging from the walls were burnt, and candles were lit in the name of a new age. The grandmaster looked to his surrounding accomplices. A half-dozen civilian governors, the general, all standing around each other in equal stoic hope and total impatience. This little ceremony was a luxury they could hardly afford, and yet here they were, standing around the republic's soon-to-be constitution. The right to vote was the first, an obvious pick since authority was established in Samara. The right to pray was, again, inherent. The power to conscript any one citizen into the armed forces was an unpopular decree, but still one many saw as essential.\n\nSo the list went, and by the time the last rights and responsibilities were uttered, all signed the piece of paper along the dotted lines and returned to their duties. How could they not, when crime and homelessness were skyrocketing? The civilians returned to their offices to direct where aid was to go, while General Bayersky returned to his duties of maintaining the fledgling national army. Grandmaster Pimen would not be so sudden to leave. Walking up and down the darkened temple, Pimen pondered whether this constitution would make any kind of a difference. With refugees pouring into Samara, Catholic or not, they'd be proving a deficit upon the nation as a whole.

His office was the bureaucratic highway into the future, and Vladkya Pimen knew just how bleak it looked. All that awaited to complete his understanding of the republic was to review its first census. His door was heaved open, and the metropolitan sighed.

This was the census.\n\nIt was a collection of seven different sheets of paper, the topmost one scarred by a coffee stain. Held together by a flimsy paper clip, it was a miracle the report hadn't fallen apart in his hands. Quickly scanning the front page, he felt a sensation of sweat and grime, probably from the ever-stressed accountants and bean-counters handing things over to someone who knew about as much on where that report was supposed to go as anyone else. Vladkya Pimen couldn't keep fooling himself. As many details as he tried to make note of, he couldn't erase that feeling in the back of his head that he needed to just read the paper. He refocused his eyes over the ink, and read. What the aides heard was not precisely describable, only really identifiable through what it must be doing to the office therein. Crackling of wood could definitely be made out, as could the splinters creeping from under the door. A wailing was equally audible, if now withering into a subdued whimper. After ten minutes of the charade, the door was finally pushed open by the metropolitan, now looking to be disheveled beyond what any of the young accountants had ever seen in their entire lives.

The thinner, second thug from the left apparently surrendered at the first opportunity and begged all the way to Samara for food. If only he knew how bad things had gotten in this city. The traitor to the middle-right seemed to yell at the hungry man - not that it could be heard over the shouting of the enraged crowds. According to his captors, Pimen had heard the madman wore a combat vest before it was seized from him, leaving him with nothing but his slacks and a green jacket. Judging from the dozen or so guns seized from his apartment, he was ready to take on the entirety of the national army. Finally, the last man seemed as though he'd be dead in a minute anyway. On the stage, he wore a heavy trench coat, and seemed nauseous while staring at his noose, and had the sick complexion of someone about to vomit bile across himself, and judging from his clothes, already had.\n\nAs the guards lifted the degenerate terrorists to their nooses, the jeering from the crowd, the pushing and shoving, grew so intense that it seemed a riot would break out.

Some were Poles, who'd fled from first the fascists and then been some of the Mad Regent's last targets. Many were Russians, fled from the same but hated by Pole and Kazakh alike for being perceived as getting off lightly. The Kazakhs were smaller in number so far north in the ASLA to begin with, but the Mad Regent's efforts had reduced that number even further.\n\nThe standoff was between representatives of all three: a grizzled Kazakh soldier who Ivan knew led a militia, a one-armed Pole clutching his party membership, and a Russian woman garbed like a nurse with an ancient rifle slung on her shoulder. Ivan didn't need to take more than a glance to know things would end in bloodshed if he didn't intervene.\n\nIt had apparently begun with the Kazakh and the Pole arguing over whose land the town had been built on to begin with, and when the Russian had tried to say it didn't matter, the response from the other two had blamed the actions of Taboritsky on Russian imperialism as a whole. Ivan supposed he should have been surprised by those thoughts, but he'd heard similar enough ones too often from gaunt sunken eyed refugees. He supposed he couldn't blame them for tying the actions of a tyrant to his people.\n\nIn the end though, he was able to disperse the three before anyone was struck. Promising to find some more homes for the injured and elderly amongst those in the tents managed to get their minds of the more petty conflict they'd been engaged in. For Ivan, it was merely another day in life. He knew something else would happen tomorrow, but that was to come. Peace had been maintained for now."

Inwardly, she cursed the Purification men for the thousandth time; the father of her two girls wasn't even Russian! He'd been an Udmurt by ancestry, not that it had mattered to the men who shot him.\n\nA thunderous explosion heralded a handful of converted trucks clattering over the nape of the hill that had allowed the column to escape the initial attack, and to Ayim's horror, there were machine guns mounted above the cabins of each. In her hurry to push her daughters behind the small crate that contained their belongings, Ayim missed the first cries of relief from ahead. But as the sound of the machine guns stopped, she finally looked out of the wagon to see a sight Allah himself couldn't have made any more welcome.\n\nOn either side of the carts ahead of her were advancing figures with red and white patches on their arms, soldiers, but not shooting at her. Horsemen yelled battle cries as they careened into the front ranks of the Purification men, giving enough time for a pair of ancient tankettes to open up with their cannons on the armed trucks. The fight that continued behind her wagon as it entered the territory of the Autonomous Soviet Liberation Army was fierce, but Ayim could only offer a quick prayer to Allah in thanks. For he had sent the righteous to save the meek, and her daughters would live another day."

The rapidly retreating penumbra had left behind several vestiges of their presence, symbols of the abhorrent suffering they had brought upon these lands. To many, they were rallying points for retribution.\n\nA resentful tempest of jagged daggers and deafening gunfire descended upon the Russian Shturmoviki guards of the slave outpost, frightened and stupefied. Unintelligible shouts and cries brimming with rage and indignation accompanied the screams of fear as sharp steel viciously cut into the flesh of petrified Russian guards, tattering their woolen uniforms, covered in fresh stains of crimson. Bursts of white, hazy smoke permeated into the air as Tatar firearms emptied their loads into the backs of fleeing men, the copper-plated bullets lodging themselves within various body parts with infallible precision. Pleads for mercy were met with the distinctive crackles of a pistol, their bodies lifelessly collapsing onto the ground.\n\nAs any semblance of opposition began to dissipate within the camp, the assailants turned their attention towards the liberation of their countrymen, rendered slaves by the Shturmoviki. They were unbound from their shackles and released from their fetters, hundreds upon hundreds returned to their homes alongside their liberators, free men once more.

Taboritsky saw that all of the peoples he deemed \"inferior\" to his Greater Russians were to be eradicated from the annals of history - his history. The scholar had witnessed himself the cruelty that had been inflicted upon his people's great works and memorable texts, the Shturmoviki proving meticulous in incinerating and shredding all matters of scripture that so much as oozed 'degeneracy'.

Most of his wards barely had an understanding of the basic history of the Tatar, barely adjusted to the general teachings. To make it worse, almost all of his peers were survivors of those horrid death camps, their minds forever hijacked by the ghastly sights they have witnessed within those fenced compounds of misery and agony - it barely left enough space for such younglings to even build the motivation to study.\n\nSlowly, he brought himself to sit down upon the front steps of the school, his shoulders forever burdened with the arduous task of salvaging a history torn to shreds and cast to the winds of fate.

He spun around, and before he could even recognize the man who'd spoken he raised the pistol and fired. The officer cried out as he crumpled to the dirt. His comrades let out shouts of fear and dove out of the way, but Yuri couldn't have cared less about them. He fired again and again at the man on the ground, emptying the clip into his gut, his chest, his head.\n\nYuri threw the pistol aside and knelt down to look at the corpse. From what was left of the face he could tell it was Fedorov. He'd always been a good officer. Ruthless, efficient; untroubled by false morality.

His eyes passed over each of them one by one.\n\n\"How fucking dare you,\" he rasped. \"New orders? Why the fuck would we need new orders? The regent's order still stands! Why would it have been rescinded? It is our order to cleanse these mountains of every last goddamn subhuman rodent hiding in them, and that order will stand until we hear otherwise.

He'd passed the nine kilometer mark, and the desiccated trees were already starting to thin out as he neared the edge of the forest, but they'd only been given forty-five minutes.\n\nTen kilometers in forty-five minutes. Three quarters of an hour to run a path straight through a forest the artillery corps used for target practice.

At 11:46 the shells would start falling. The gunners were practicing with mustard gas today. Konstantin hadn't believed it at first.

He rounded a corner and beheld the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen. The edge of the trail, and there, a few meters further, five idling trucks with a few guards standing around them.

Twisted corpses, scattered like dolls around the campsite. Some were splayed out, clawing at the poisoned earth. Others huddled around each other even in death, the last remains of the degenerate families that had tried to flee his army. All were covered in the same burns that white phosphorus left. Deep scorch marks covering the entire body, skin so charred it became brittle, paperlike. Evtukhovich felt nauseous. He hated garlic.\n\nHe was looking at the remains of what had once been a baby, cradled in its mothers arms, when he noticed one of the Shturmoviki officers approaching him. \"We've rounded up the survivors sir, we're preparing to execute them now, with your permission.\"\n\nEvtukhovich paused for a moment, as though he were contemplating some profound statement, before speaking, \"Hold off, for now.

No sooner had the earliest rumors of Taboritsky's death reached Mikhail Pervukhin's hideout in the mountains, than he set about preparing for the expulsion of Orenburg's isolated garrison. When it came, it was but a mere formality, with the imperials scattering at the first sight of an organized attack.\n\nGeneral Secretary Pervukhin, henceforth the competent authority in the areas which long ago had belonged to the eponymous anarchist council, quickly endeared himself to the local population by overseeing the liquidation of Taboritsky's regional kapos. He knew well enough, however, that the task of government would be far more unpleasant. Imperial rule had been particularly unkind to the Southern Urals: the fields which were not merely fallow lay poisoned, the factories that had not been entirely stripped had suffered some other form of ruination, internal commerce was nonexistent, an effective bureaucracy had never existed in the first place... Pervukhin sighed.\n\nLooking up at the map of the Southern Urals kindly left at Government House by its deceased prior occupant, the general secretary grimaced. It was an almost ancient map by this stage, produced during the later-days of Soviet rule, as marked by the CCCP watermark on its legend. That in and of itself was a reminder of the achievements of Bolshevik civilization; what little remained of a functional society could be traced back to the achievements of the Union alone.\n\nPervukhin's mind harkened back to the days of 1918 and 1921. Was Russia then no less savaged by reaction than it was now? Did the Bolshevik spirit, incarnate in Lenin, Kaganovich, and Stalin, not suffice to overcome the penury of Russia's situation then? If those men had managed to thrust the vastness of the Motherland into modernity, then he could put the pseudo-Makhnoite peasantry of a few oblasts back on the right track. That feat could be accomplished only through the methods of his mentors.\n\nMaterial balance planning, democratic centralism, and a strong Red Army were the correct ways to run a state, whether the uppity muzhik liked it or not. For their part, the anarchists should be content that after the demonstrated failure of their fantasy government, he was benevolent enough to allow their existence to be reflected in the country's new name: 'Revolutionary Communes of Orenburg' did have a nice appeal to them after all, even if there were no communes."

With political commissars by their side, a handful of poor rifle slavemen underneath, and their close relatives under Cheka watch, these men became Pervukhin's military backbone.\n\nApart from the few raids by Kazakh purifiers in the south, however, the Ural Red Army was often more preoccupied with the 'Internal Enemies of the Revolution' than those on the outside. Initially, this was taken to mean what few sympathizers the Taboritsky regime had had in Orenburg, or what few local bourgeois organized to resist the expropriation of their factories. Nowadays, however, the term invariably described the anarchist peasantry, which had taken offence not only to policies of the revolutionary government, but to the general secretary himself.\n\nFor his part, Captain Lukomsky did not much blame the peasants. No sooner had the red flags been raised over Orenburg, than particularly pervasive, sometimes even cartoonish, depictions of Mikhail Pervukhin - whether in print or stone - became a staple of life in the communes. The cause of this particular unrest was the replacement of a statue in memory of the Orenburg's Workers' Council, with one of Pervukhin, which depicted him standing right beside Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and Lazar Kaganovich. Lukomsky thought it gross, and the peasants' distaste for it justified; but if his time in the Ural League's army had taught him anything, it was that orders were orders.\n\n\"Fire.\" The three dozen Red Army men under his command opened up on the muzhik mob, as had by now become customary. The cold, miserable winter weather made the scene even more dreadful, as Lukomsky struggled to clear his nose while kicking away the bodies of anarchists which had fallen at the side of the statue they had attempted to topple. From the particular homes of the God-forsaken village, the political commissar and his chosen few brought back seized anarchist memorabilia to use as firewood. Black flags, deviationist literature, pornography. All these, it was decreed, should burn at the altar of the general secretary. And so they did."

That was not so with the NKVD, whose list of clergymen - Taboritskyite or otherwise - had been steadily growing since the first few scraps of graffiti-penned kill lists redacted in the Bolsheviks' Ural hideouts.\n\nTo Vasily Alenxandrovich Petrov, the task was not particularly pleasant. Growing up during the first warlord era, religion had been present in his homestead: killing one's childhood is never easy. Nevertheless, the institution's collaboration with Taboritsky condemned it even in Petrov's eyes. And so, he led his dozen men into the temple, pushing away the few raggedly dressed priests who pleaded to prevent a ransacking.\n\n\"If only they'd fought this hard against Taboritsky.\" Petrov's political officer let out a laugh as he demeaned a bearded man, clinging on to a Bible. Most of the company laughed - ever so uneasily - with him, as the butt of a Kalashnikov left the old man lying on the ground. The rest of the platoon, outside the church, fired off a warning shot at the local rabble, which had not taken long to notice what the bonfire was being set up for.

Everyone else pretended, and everyone else knew too. The dark clouds, a permanent testament to their fate, perhaps God's judgement to some, loomed over the collective farm almost every day. When he raised his hoe again and felt the poisoned earth, he breathed out something in annoyance, perhaps a curse word - he wasn't sure himself. Then, just as soon after he spoke, he heard the voice of Mikhail next to him, amidst the many other farmers nearby.\n\n\"Irritated, are you now, Ilya?\" He asked. Ilya heard, but both men continued working, as stopping was not an option. \"This is the sweat and blood-\" Mikhail took a sharp breath, \"-that will be necessary for the spirit of communism to return, you know.\"\n\n\"Again with the revolution farce...\" Ilya sighed, and he could feel Mikhail become a little annoyed. He was a determined Bolshevik, that much Ilya knew, and when he found some satisfaction under Bukharin, he hated the communes, and then welcomed Pervukhin. \"We're supposed to till this soil and make it arable in the span of two months. How in God's name are we supposed to do that?\"\n\n\"I can't say for sure, but a duty is a duty.\" Mikhail responded, voice ragged and determined. \"I happily turned over my farmland to the government to do this, and I would not want to see the fruits of my labor unreaped!\"\n\n\"And...\" Another strike, another breath. \"What happens if we don't meet it? You've seen how Pervukhin treated the anarchists. What if we fail our quota? What if we meet-\"\n\n\"The anarchists were traitors,\" Mikhail hissed, his voice turning cold, but Ilya knew the old Bolshevik held some uncertainty in his tone. He knew many of them, as acquaintances, as friends, even. \"And besides, have you looked around us? Have you even seen what the world is like?\" Mikhail's voice grew haggard."

While it may have been seen as excessive and demonstrative of the exaltation of industry to hold the opening of an agricultural tools factory in such esteem, it truly was deserving of the importance. Taboritsky's reign of terror had so thoroughly ransacked the Southern Urals that the construction of even such a basic industry became a groundbreaking event, worthy of celebration and a Red Army parade.\n\nThe general secretary was of course present for the opening of the M.G. Pervukhin Agricultural Tooling Factory, as were the People's Commissars for Foreign Affairs, Labor, Industry, and Agriculture. Pervukhin was not alone however, with the People's Commissars for Military Affairs, Communications, Justice, and Education, also in attendance. There were a few important military figures, alongside what few technicians were available, all there to celebrate this great achievement of reborn Russian socialism. One group who shined through their absence however, were the workers themselves.\n\nIndeed, all workers with the technical skill to operate industrial machinery were over the mountains and far away, busily toiling in the collectivized farms. The food situation in the cities was so dire that they could hardly be spared for industrial production, that would be double whammy at any rate. Thus, Secretary Pervukhin had devised a solution which would be beneficial to all:\n\nWhat few members of the deposed government had not been executed, alongside the detained anarchist intellectuals, and Kazakhs taken prisoners during frontier battles, all had long sat at Cheka camps consuming the proletariat's food. Now, however, they would have to provide redemptive labor for it, with reduced rations of course, only fair in the face of the worsening agricultural crisis.\n\nSurely, these actions might be retroactively considered excessive, but as far as Pervukhin was concerned, they were just and necessary. When Russia once more found itself united and prospering under the Red Banner, it would be this factory they could trace national redemption to."

All was silent but the soft clicks of his footsteps, all was dark but the glimmer of his escorts' candles. Demons danced behind every shadow, the souls of the damned whispered in his ears. The door ahead opened, blinding him with the orange light and heat of a thousand burning lanterns. There sat the high priest upon his gothic throne, peering down at Nikolay from behind his ram skull mask. Nikolay fell to his knees and touched his forehead to the hallowed ground. The robed men raised their lanterns, and in dry monotone chanted \"Rege Satanas, Ave Satanas, Abaddon, dirige nos.\"\n\n\"Rise, initiate\" the high priest ordered. At once, Nikolay stood, locking eyes with the slender figure before him. His old commander was unrecognizable. The skin around his eyes was sullen, his gaze was dull, his expression hollow. The man who Nikolay once knew as Colonel Anatoly Motsny was nowhere to be seen, in his place only a soulless vessel sustained by dark sorcery - Abaddon, the archangel of destruction, the progeny of Cain.\n\nNikolay was silent, straining to disguise his growing terror, as the high priest rose from his throne and placed a dagger in his hand. Though his heart brimmed with fear and his soul cried in agony, he gripped it tightly. Nikolay slid the steel blade across his own chest, wincing as he tore a piece of flesh from his body. He clenched it in his fist, hesitating only for a moment before placing it onto his tongue. Abaddon held a silver chalice to Nikolay's chest, pressing it firmly against the wound. The blood thickened even as it rushed to fill the vessel. Nikolay grasped the chalice, putting it to his lips that he may receive the unholy communion. \"Rege Satanas,\" Nikolay began, blood oozing across his torso and sliding down the back of his throat. \"Ave Satanas, Abaddon, dirige nos.\"\n\nThe high priest slid a finger over Nikolay's bleeding chest and marked his forehead with the Petrine Cross. \"Welcome, Initiate, to the Brotherhood of Cain.\""

The muscle gurgled as he squeezed, its tendons tore like fabric, and Abaddon raised the very cradle of the woman's soul in front of her dying eyes. \"I have listened, my Lord! With this, I honor thee!\"\n\nA symphony rang in his ears, an unholy screeching that grew louder and louder. \"I am here, my Lord, I am here!\" The notes twisted in his head, a concerto of strings and flutes, rising and descending in pitch, cutting out and returning, slowing and quickening.

His bones were possessed by an otherworldly force, energy escaped his body, belts of electricity cracked between his temples. \"Almighty Lucifer! Where have you gone? Adonai's agents defile your soil! The Jew-lovers pray before his idols, they rally behind his false prophets! Lend Russia your strength. Lend Russia your vengeance. Oh Morning Star, give me your instructions!\"\n\nThe roar of clarinets were the lies of the apostles, each trumpet blast an angel's curse, but through the degenerate noise a lone voice still hummed from below. Abaddon opened his eyes, his attentive gaze turned to the heart on the floor. The spatterings of blood told the paths ahead, every drop a warning, every smear an instruction.

Drinks filled goblets and soldiers sang. The Warriors of Cain beat and whipped the assembled slaves, with no regard to their race or gender, every cry or scream became a prayer for the coming raid's success. They defiled holy icons with blood and piss, snuffed strange powders to summon strength for the battle, stripped each other naked, and screamed hymms to the morning star in bliss.\n\nVladimir's mind was flooded with memories of piety, how proud he was to be confirmed, his mother's tales of the ancient Hebrews. The hand of God reached down to Vladimir, he whose soul was still not corrupted, he whose mind was still bound by empathy. But the fires of temptation burned in his loins, the serpent's words coursed through his spirit. Why did God watch as his family was shot? Why did he do nothing as the Arch-Jew trampled Russia?

They bound her with rope, stabbed a syringe into her arm, and threw her into the truck.\n\nValery's joints groaned, his rigid footsteps led him behind a line of emaciated bodies. Abaddon's riders led the men like cattle, shambling toward the quarry. Valery felt a pop in his knee, letting out a gasp as his legs collapsed beneath him. One rider lifted him by his hair, another smashed his nose with the stock of his rifle. He choked on phlegm and blood as they bludgeoned his body, too weak to do anything but wince as a bayonet penetrated his abdomen. The others could only continue their march, broken spirits deaf to the crushing of bone. As they labored without respite, they saw a cross erected at the entrance.

Five stakes of pine were planted at its edges, and wooden spokes ran between them to form a pentagram raised two meters in the air. At its center stood the Son of God crucified in effigy, his body built from wood and rope, his head that of a pig wrapped in a crown of thorns.\n\nThe audience watched in silent apprehension as the masked men brought captives from the backs of carts. Thieves, captives taken on raids, rebellious slaves, worshippers of the Jew-God. Each had been stripped of their clothing, their hands tied behind their backs. The riders marched them into the circle, securing their hands to the spokes and leaving them hanging by their wrists. Some screamed, some cried, some wriggled feebly, and some quietly accepted their fates. Some townsfolk whimpered, some closed their eyes or diverted their vision. Mothers covered their children's mouths so that their wailing would not draw notice.\n\nFrom the assembled brothers stepped Abaddon in his ram-skull mask, carrying a trident in his left hand and a torch in his right. In an impassioned voice, booming that all may hear him, he began his prayer. \"Oh Lucifer, oh Prince of Darkness! I consecrate you a most holy city, I offer you a temple upon the Earth! Lend your strength unto me, impart your blessings on the New Babylon! May you silence the foul agents of Jerusalem and take vengeance upon them! Oh Morning Star, may your glory be known by all peoples!\" He kneeled before the straw circle, and through his torch he summoned the fury of Hell. Four dozen voices screamed in terror, their eyes wide as hell raced toward their bodies. Their hair withered, their skin blistered, their very tears were turned to steam. Agonized screams and mortified cries broiled into the surrounding air, a cacophony of suffering pointed at Adonai himself. Smoke billowed upwards, and Hell became manifest upon the Earth."

Within the chaos of the Russian Anarchy he had shaped himself into a thief, stealing whatever he needed to survive from those too weak to protect their possessions. As the shadow of Taboritsky's regime stretched across Russia, he was imprisoned and sentenced to die. He thought his luck was shifting when the Redeemed Black League sprung him from prison during the chaos of Regency's collapse. However, looking at what was supposed to be his 'training camp' he knew that thought to be foolish.\n\nHe recognized the people around him; they were fellow prisoners he knew from his time behind bars, murderers and thieves. They were surrounded by towering steel walls, with faceless guards manning the battlements staring right through each and every 'recruit', waiting for them to step even an inch out of line. Their 'barracks' was a crowded tent filled with lumpy beds that lacked pillows or blankets. There was no place for any of them to store personal possessions or even spare sets of clothes. They were expected to wear the one uniform they were granted at all times, a constant reminder of who they were supposed to be.\n\nThere was not enough of anything to go around. Not enough equipment, not enough beds, not enough food. They were expected to fight for their right to live, for the \"redemption\" that they were offered from this new Black League. So that is what they did, each and every recruit fought for every scrap of food that they could, while the masked guards on the walls watched them, assessing them all.\n\nAs time went on they were privileged to be visited by a small team of drill sergeants. These men would begin the arduous process of taming the wild animals that they had created. Week by week, drill by drill, the recruits were trained. Once, when Viktor beat another recruit in a fight, he was awarded with an additional serving of food, the loser sent into solitary confinement without food."

If the Black League was to survive this Great Trial and prevail against the masses of barbaric warlords then they must forge a nation of iron, one that will not bend or break to the invading hordes. To achieve this he and his staff had put together the Militarized Village Program, an initiative to concentrate the Black League's population into easy to defend strongholds and fortify them to withstand any enemy incursion.\n\nHe and the rest of the Black League knew that these people would resist being relocated, weakened by sentimentality and a poorly placed pride in their heritage. This mattered not to Lazarenko or his staff. These people were not true members of the Black League, instead they were mere pawns to be used in the furthering of the Black League's interests. They would be relocated at gunpoint regardless of their wishes, anyone who resisted would be shot without warning.\n\nConcentrating everybody into these strongholds also possessed another upside for the Black League. These peasants would be easy to survey and control. Under the watchful eye of the Black League, Lazarenko could make sure that these peasants served their purpose in the Great Trial. They would provide their labor, their minds, their possessions, and their lives, all in an effort towards the League's greater goal.\n\nIt was the duty of Lazarenko and the Redeemed Black League to save Russia from itself. The reason she had failed in all of the prior trials was due to her unruly and savage people. Yazov's great failing was his inability to see this immutable truth. This new League will raise generations of true Russians, Russians that will give anything, including their life, for the Black League."

Corpses had begun to gather all around the camps, with more piling up everyday. At first, the stench had been unbearable for him and the rest of the \"recruits\", but after a while their noses had gone numb to it. Some of them starved to death, unable to fight for their right to eat, others had died from diseases due to the increasingly filthy nature of the camp. The rest had been killed, either by the guards or their fellow recruits.\n\nThose who remained had changed from their time spent within the camp. They had become more violent, acting almost like rabid beasts rather than human beings. Altercations over food or equipment escalated from fist fights into brutal life or death combat. Everybody fought like they like their life depended on it because they all knew that it did. In this place Viktor had no friends, just rivals for survival.\n\nOnce a week, members of the Black League visited to check up on the progress of their recruits and to provide combat training. These were the only men the recruits truly feared. Anything that could be considered a slight towards a ranking officer was punished severely. A week in solitary for minor offenses, and death for major offenses. Like rabid dogs wearing shock collars, the only thing these recruits truly feared was their masters.\n\nDuring his time at the camp, Viktor learned every way he could possibly kill a person. Through instruction from the Black League and his own personal experience fighting for his life he had been made into a skilled killer. Only the strong could survive the Black League's \"recruitment\" process, and Viktor refused to die here, no matter the cost."

The imperial government however, had been far, far worse. Citizens forced out of their homes, people shot in the streets, the violence was as limitless as it was senseless. They were not living under the imperial government anymore though, for the Black League had returned.\n\nAlthough they wrapped themselves in the imagery and style of the old Black League, this new League was very different. Their sworn enemy was no longer the Germanic Teutons - instead they found their enemy in the very people of Russia. They blamed their fellow Russians for their failures to defeat Germany, time and time again. The result was a regime that did not even see their citizens as people, instead they were resources to use in raising future generations of Black League zealots.\n\nThe streets of Yekaterinburg were lined with men of the Internal Security Directorate. Their faces were covered with gas masks and their arms carried assault rifles. They watched the city's residents, punishing even the most minor of transgressions with extreme cruelty. At night, the men of the ISD raid the homes of everyday citizens, taking any form of personal possession forbidden by the Black League. Harmless trinkets like comic books and children's toys were stolen and destroyed. Like cattle, the people of Yekaterinburg were kept alive only to carry out their uses to the Black League, and nothing more."

The Black League had arrived in her village, here to 'cleanse' the population. She had heard tales of the Black League raiding villages far from their new headquarters in Yekaterinburg, but she never imagined she would cross paths with them. Her thoughts were interrupted as a stray bullet emerged from her window, grazing her shoulder. Backing away from the window she knew she had to escape. Rushing to a small shack near her house, another stray bullet grazed her leg. It took all her willpower to not draw attention to herself by screaming.\n\nThese 'soldiers' fought more like rabid animals than human beings. Their rifles were all mismatched, afixed with sharpened scraps of metal to serve as makeshift bayonets. As they ran out of ammo in their weapons, rather than reload most of them just dropped their weapons and began to kill people with their own hands or knives. The men of the Black League spared nobody, not even the children.\n\nThe brutality they unleashed upon this small village was almost puzzling. Katerina had seen her village suffer raids many times before, but those men were sadistic, they engaged in cruelty for their own enjoyment. These men however, did not seem to enjoy any of the horrors they were unleashing upon her people. In fact, in the brief glimpses she got of their faces, they didn't seem to feel anything at all. They showed zero emotion as they mercilessly slaughtered this village. Not enjoyment nor regret, not pleasure nor pain. It was as if they were not even present anymore.\n\nStill in the small shack and fearing for her life, Katerina waited for all of the 'soldiers' around her to be occupied. It pained her to use the suffering and deaths of people she once thought of as friends to escape this, but she had no other option. When she thought an opportunity presented itself she bolted from the shack heading east. Unfortunately for her, someone had taken notice. She tried to run as fast as she could, but her leg was still bleeding. It didn't take long for the man behind her to catch up."

That's how it looked like to a young Shturmoviki stuck in the Kazakh plains around Aktau, the scorching sun beating down on him as he tried to fiddle with a shoddy radio. It had been days since his comrades had ceased to answer his calls, and God knows how long since the Regent had returned to him. He was alone, in a land far different from the Siberian village he grew up in, and filled with subhumans he'd swore to purify in the name of the Holy Russian Empire.\n\nYet in spite of being seemingly stranded in a forsaken land, he kept hoping that he'd hear anything on his radio, anything that would give him some semblance of hope. And for a second, it seemed as if his hopes were coming true as the radio picked up a signal: \"To all the Russian dogs still defiling these lands, the time of retribution has come for you. The crimes committed by the Mad Regent and his rabid dogs shall be avenged: for every slight committed against the Kazakh people, it shall be punished tenfold. I, Safa Gaziz, Grand Marshal of the Purification Army make this promise. We will come for you, your wives and children, your precious homes and churches, and your beloved motherland. As you plundered our lands and smothered our blue sky into one as black as your heart, so shall we. The sons of Genghis and Tamerlane shall bring fear to Russia once more!\"\n\nThe soldier felt disgust, as well as amazement that a Kazakh would even be able to handle any kind of technology. But most of all he felt despair as the prospect of rescue seemed dim, and out of this feeling of despair, fear grew in his heart as he clutched ever so tightly to his rifle."

This would be a costly mistake, and their last at that.\n\nIn an instant, our warriors swooped in the village, lording of the Slavic scum as they gunned them down with no distinction, exulting in making them pay for the crimes done under the centuries old Russian yoke. As their houses burned and their neighbors laid dead, the remaining villagers tried fleeing to the sea in a last ditch effort to save their pathetic lives.\n\nA futile effort. From the banks of the sea, the soldiers of the KPA would gun them down as they stood on top of their horses.

Worse, some had even mingled with those devils, diluting the pure blood of the Kazakh population over time.\n\nA divided house now finds itself at a crossroad: should it find peace in letting old wounds be healed over time, leaving families reuniting despite differences? Or are some lines meant to not be crossed? Evidently, Gaziz had no want for peaceful reconciliation in his mind as he ordered \"race traitors\" to be purged.\n\nDay and night, the KPA soldiers took care of the question: they tortured and hanged those who fought under the USSR, leaving their corpses as warning at the entrances of Aktau.

To find the answer to this comrades, you need not look at the banners of the degenerates and whores that occupied these lands for so many years. The Russians! These subhumans and those complacent with our oppression! The Uzbekis! The Iranians! The Tajiks! And why did they oppress us so? My comrades, the answer of course, is they were terrified of the demonstrable superiority of Kazakh blood! We are an ancient, noble people! Why, one must only look at the incredible achievements of our people throughout history-\"\n\nThe speech was quickly silenced by Amir cutting off the power to radio. He was no fool.

For so long, war had been a constant as they fought each other, only to weaken themselves when the Russians had invaded, enslaved, and slaughtered them. They had never both been unified or free before.\n\nNow... maybe that could change.\n\nThe remaining families and clans alive had managed to come together, resolving to settle on the Jaxartes and survive.

Tents had been erected, routines established, and slowly they had all begun to heal. There only remained the lingering question - What now?\n\nTheir homes were destroyed, their land poisoned, and their people slaughtered by the Russians, but they were now... free.

A number of other explosions sounded as the other women in her unit did the same.\n\n\"Again.\" Officer Rustemov ordered. He was an old veteran of the Kazakh Red Army, a man missing an eye and with a patchy beard. He had been heavily involved in drilling the militia units that had been formed in recent weeks. The genocidal men to their west, and the concern that what emerged from the remnants of Russia may attempt to reclaim Kazakhstan had driven the need to have a fighting force - even if it had to be built from the ground up.\n\nThere was no shortage of volunteers, and thanks to the amount of weapons and ordinance that had been left behind or abandoned by the Russians, they didn't have to worry about supplies. It wasn't enough for an army - but it was enough for them.

Mendriks and the other soldiers took him in, a no-life thief, and shaped him into a man, with something to live for, something to protect. The Yasha of old wouldn't ever sacrifice anything for anyone, but Yasha remembers vividly and proudly the memories of hastily assembling sandbags on an abandoned house, the faint memories of Dirlewanger's pillagers' cars roaring in the distance... Success was hard on and almost made up the loss of part of his ear to a stray shot that day...\n\nThen, the dammable Regent, and his twisted corpse of an empire came...\n\nThey've tried their best. They, really, really did. Yasha pushes his wheelchair, one of the wheels slightly rusty, and harder to push than the other, and one of the tires clearly empty, and yet was nothing short of a commodity around these parts. Half of his face is permanently paralyzed, making it fairly awkward to breathe with only one active nostril; his legs are gone, replaced by wooden pegs, and burns across his body, Yasha looks much older than any forty-odd year veteran has any right to be.\n\nYet he's alive. And as he lowers a wreath with his good arm, surrounded by veterans like him, covered in their war tales, he can't help but cry, as the memories flood the young, yet aged soul. The statue is a recent thing, built from remaining rubble, the fruit of a surviving sculptor, fled from the harrowing shadow that befell what remained of his home in Yekaterinburg, depict a man he never met, but heard tales from other veterans, and came to admire as much as he did Mendriks himself; Pavel Batov, cradling a dying Ural Guard soldier, a scene he came to see so many times...\n\nWith immense effort, he did one shaky salute, to the patriot he never met, but felt he knew for ages."

 after_midnight.137.desc: "Nikolai Kardashev lifted his head from the paperwork he had been working through all night. Through the full-length window which replaced one of the walls of his office, countless dots of sparkling and shining lights contrasted against the pitch-dark and onyx-black tapestry of space. Even in the unending nightmare which was now Russia, some things - like the enigmatic sky - would always stay constant.\n\nWhere the factories and apartment blocks littering the Siberian municipality would once years ago shine with industrial floodlights late into the darkest hours of the night, there was now utter darkness. That nighttime glow and buzz was what had previously eclipsed the stars above; it was only with their extinguishing that he could see their radiance. The city, and purportedly many others, had been cut off from the power grid for weeks as the nation fell into utter chaos. Hunger and poverty was everywhere - even more so than under that madman Taboritsky's empire, and there was not enough food or even water to go around. Would Chelyabinsk or Russia ever heal from the three injuries she had been afflicted with - the two Great Patriotic Wars and now the lunatic's rule?\n\nYet, in spite of the crushing sorrow and despair all around him, Kardashev stayed hopeful. Like the stars he glimpsed, there were those things which would be eternal and unchanging. The days of dictators and tyrants, of Taboritskys and Hitlers, would eventually pass with time, and Russia would rebuild what was left of herself. They always did, and they will again. Through it all, it would be science - knowledge, enlightenment, and all the good virtues of truth - which would prevail without fail. Its survival here in Chelyabinsk was the strongest proof he could've asked for. He merely hoped his own efforts would not be wasted."

We-\"\n\n\"And how about the refugees coming from the west? How many are there? Where are they being kept?\"\n\n\"We don't have enough data on that either.\"\n\nKardashev's head throbbed with a migraine as he considered the information his ministers had presented to him - or, more aptly, the absence of information which they had informed him of.\n\nHe knew that the path to building a utopia would be a rocky one - one filled with countless obstacles and hurdles, and whose diverging paths would be fogged and unclear - but there would at least be some direction to his labors. Without any solid information of what was actually going on in Chelyabinsk, even how the road should begin was unknown.\n\nKardashev, after all, was devoted to science - he was a career physicist - and what did science value most? Data. Without it, what could he and his ministers know for certain? Without it, how could even the most simple jobs be performed optimally? How could he know whether their policies were actually working as intended or delivering results?\n\nHe dismissed the council, telling them once more to brainstorm ways to accrue data, and reminding them of the importance of the first task of the Institute. Yet, in everyone's minds there, dread had settled - dread of not being able to live up to their dreams, of failing to make something better out of the ruins of old Russia, and of leaving the sick and the tired to their damned fates."

 after_midnight.139.desc: "The conference had been called by Comrade Kardashev to discuss the direction that the newly-founded Chelyabinsk Institute should follow, as well as the needs of the citizens of the city. Amongst those assembled were formerly seasoned politicians and officials from the local government of Chelyabinsk prior to the conquest of West Siberia, the handful of competent bureaucrats and administrators still left in the area, and Kardashev's kindred scientists and experts.\n\nThe debate would begin with the hunger crisis. With the black void of data they had, it was difficult to properly formulate a response; no one really knew what the people were going through, how severe the shortages were, or how many were affected by them. The conclusion of the conference was that the crisis was very severe if only taking into account official importation of food as reported at the border, but was realistically less severe, a statement which in no way could give any information on the actual availability of food for the average citizen.\n\nThen there was the matter of allocating other resources - goods not required for survival but greatly important to the functioning of modern society such as gas for heating and electricity. Those needs, however, came not just from the citizens, but also from industry and commercial entities, as well as the government. How were they to be distributed? Again, lack of information was a critical issue, as the committee didn't know what areas were most severely lacking in said resources nor agreed on what needed it most. For instance, Kardashev's scientist clique were fond of using calculations and planning to allocate resources to the mathematically most important channels - for instance, industry for production of other important goods, perhaps at the expense of the commercial sector or some parts of the population.\n\nIn the end, the conference only solidified the need for a thorough census and survey to gather information, resulting in little actual change in policy or opinion amongst the governing committee of the Institute."

His brother had died to the Taborite chambers of the empire, and he had only narrowly escaped the grip of the Regent's government through wit and sheer luck. Though they seemed a little out of touch and idealistic, Dmitry didn't care as long as he wasn't hunted down for minor infractions or gassed for being distantly related to a Freemason. They promised to rebuild the city, to provide for its people, and to establish a new society - and who could disagree with that, after years of suffering and anguish?\n\nYet, it was too good to be true. His initial impression of the scientist clique being elitist and aloof turned out to be correct - it had been months since they took over the city, but basic access to food and water was still rare in his neighborhood, while officials proclaimed that progress was being made and spouted on and on the same rubbish about sacrifice. If any change was happening, he definitely wasn't seeing it.\n\n\"Give us bread!\"\n\nCertainly, neither were the thousands who were marching with him in protest to petition the government to allocate more food, medicine, and gas to the needy. He was one of the luckier ones - he wasn't malnourished or ill as many others in the crowd were, but he had seen his neighbors and relatives struggle to get by. That was why he'd chosen to take action and join the protest, organized by workers who had been disgruntled with shortage after shortage. He had had his own fair share of starvation during the reign of Taboritsky, and had only recently been able to have real meals again. Others had not been so fortunate, and their pain had not been soothed by Kardashev's taking power."

What's all the commotion about? They've gotten far more militant today, and my secretary told me they tried to break in.\"\n\nAn awkward silence cast itself across the room. The security minister finally piped up after several long moments. \"It has to do with last night.\" He nodded at the other two representatives of the security forces in the room. \"To give you the long and short of it, amidst the tensions in the protests yesterday, a few of our men got spooked and opened live fire. Six confirmed dead as of right now, and three others severely injured as a direct or indirect result of their actions.\"\n\nThe room was silent, stunned for a moment, before it broke out into frenzied discussion in whispers between members next to each other. One advisor, an esteemed scientist, spoke up, his face blanched\n\n\"This will be a PR disaster for us, Comrade Kardashev, if what Smolyakov is saying is true.\"\n\n\"PR disaster?

Some would claim that the city was still firmly under control and nothing out of the ordinary was occurring, while others claimed that it had descended into a full-scale civil war between mutinous units, and nearly all of them contradicted the initial message about an impending attack from outside forces.\n\nThen, after hours of confusion and panic at the communications center, Yekaterinburg finally went dark. Not long after the total loss of contact with the city itself, similarly confused and contradictory messages began to flood in from areas all across the Urals.

 after_midnight_coup.6.d: "The armored car rolled through Vyatka, the swastika and icon of the Holy Russian Empire emblazoned on its chassis in bold paint. Lukova watched as it passed, flinching in fear and hiding behind a crumbled wall. It wouldn't be out of character for such a vehicle to open fire on a cowering citizen just as Taboritsky had purged the destitute in Syktyvkar. Instead of bullets, the car sprayed sound, emitting from crackling speakers that jutted like gargoyles from its turret.\n\n\"Christians, fellow Russians,\" began the unmistakable voice of the second Blessed Regent, \"I come to you with disturbing news.\" Lukova, still in hiding, wondered why Larionov had bothered to specify. All news in the Holy Russian Empire was disturbing to some degree. \"Sergey Taboritsky, our fallen and former Blessed Regent, was, according to his own words written in a secret diary, a Jew.\" Onlookers gasped, adopted expressions of surprise, or said nothing as they shuffled away from the propaganda car. Lukova did nothing, said nothing, there was no point in doing so. Taboritsky a Jew? Surely, that had to be a lie.\n\n\"Like all Jews,\" continued the voice of the Blessed Regent, \"Taboritsky possessed a twisted mind, and I tell you with sorrow that he planned to murder Alexei as a sacrifice to his Hebrew deity when our beloved Tsarevich returned. I and my companions were forced to act.\"\n\n\"Yes, my fellow Christians, my ascension to the position of Blessed Regent was done out of love for you, for Christ. Taboritsky was slain by the judgement of God, and it was God who ordained that I save the Holy Russian Empire from the taint of Jewery. Hebrews still lurk amongst us, good Christians, we must be ever vigilant for their tricks and lies.\"\n\nThe car rolled on, deeper into Vyatka, the speech carrying on, fading as it grew further and further from Lukova's hiding place. Did it matter to her if Taboritsky had been a Jew? Certainly not, and certainly not now that Larionov promised only more pain, more pogroms, more death. Did the truth matter at all?"

 after_midnight_reunification.23.desc: "在神圣俄罗斯帝国的骇人崩溃以后，大多数报告都预测俄罗斯的分裂状态将持续十几年。但最近的一则报告称，一个自称“欧亚联合共和国”的政府已经恢复了对至少是部分前苏联领土的控制。\n\n在米哈伊尔·巴加诺夫的领导下，欧亚联合共和国是一个高压的威权政府，但仍然比之前的那个政府好了无数倍。巴加诺夫政府已经宣布，当前国家的首要任务是保障人民的安全，并摧毁境内残余的法西斯势力。尽管俄罗斯仍因绵延数十年的暴力与仇恨而伤痕累累，但巴加诺夫还是带着欧亚大陆向光明迈出了自己的一步。\n"

 after_midnight_reunification.24.desc: "随着西方政府与俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国正式建立外交关系，前苏联东部的统一基本完成。\n\n该政权的诞生可上溯至塔博里茨基政权的最后时日，在南乌拉尔地区的一次叛乱。在其首都奥伦堡，主席米哈伊尔·别尔乌辛将城市封锁了一段时间，在此期间，该地区经历了残酷的集体化与快速的工业化。\n\n虽然对别尔乌辛政权的具体情况知之甚少，但围绕它的讨论，主要集中在赞扬其恢复俄罗斯人民物质生活条件上。然而，人们对其严苛压制的国家机器、个人崇拜和暴力倾向提出了广泛的批评，这与它那嗜血、反动的前辈相差无几。\n"

 after_midnight_reunification.25.desc: "自从多年前俄国革命的初次改革以来，“君主制”一词在这个幅员辽阔的国家就没有再流传过。然而，今天，俄罗斯人民再次与帝国结缘。这个自称“阿列克谢二世·罗曼诺夫”的人从伊尔库茨克夺得兵权，并征服了整个俄罗斯。神奇的是，这位宣称者今天登上了王位，宣告了俄罗斯人民帝国的成立。\n\n阿列克谢二世的统治方法很是独特：他试图将布尔什维克原则和沙皇权力结合起来，形成一个工人拥护的君主制。虽然君主制和布尔什维主义势不两立，但阿列克谢二世致力于使他的理想政府发挥作用，即使他面临着来自铁杆保皇派和共产党人的嘲笑。\n\n即使这位俄罗斯君主仍有诸多谜团，世界各国领导人依然确信，他的统治不会像塔博里茨基的神圣俄罗斯帝国那样闹得天怒人怨。\n"

 after_midnight_reunification.26.desc: "就在几年前，哈萨克族似乎注定要被灭亡。但在塔博里茨基帝国的废墟上，出现了一支摆脱外国统治的哈萨克民族，他们奇迹般地团结成一个国家，速度快过了任何分析家的设想。哈萨克斯坦幸存的人民仅凭着血缘、信仰和自由生活的意愿而联合起来，组成了一个独立的民主联盟。\n\n人民在摄政统治下所遭受的共同苦难，让大多数人对专制制度不屑一顾，并对基于舒拉会议的新民主制度给予热情支持。新共和国的城镇和部族高度自治，为了卫国与互助而合众为一。尽管他们那漫长的复兴之路才刚刚开始，但自由的哈萨克人民团结一致，对抗所有试图重新征服他们的敌人。\n"

 WORLD.18111.d: "谢尔盖·塔博里茨基，蒙上帝洪恩的神圣俄罗斯帝国摄政，已经去世。\n\n在他的守夜仪式上，他以早已去世的皇太子阿列克谢·罗曼诺夫名义建立的帝国分崩离析。他建立的一切——金碧辉煌的大教堂和凤采鸾章的庄园都被湮灭的祸水冲垮。土地寸草不生，人民四散奔逃。千百万俄罗斯族和其他种族的性命，都如同风中烛火般熄灭，他们腐烂的血肉和骨骸浸润了俄罗斯的土地，更浸透了她的灵魂。俄罗斯母亲与他们一同尖叫着坠入深渊。\n\n经历了这般摧残的俄罗斯永远得不到救赎。或许几十年后，俄罗斯母亲将会如同一位浑身爬满伤疤，精神失常的老妪般，披着腐朽的裹尸布，竭尽全力，哭泣着从灰烬中再度艰难地站起来。就连注视着俄罗斯大地的上帝也要对它疾首蹙额。\n"
