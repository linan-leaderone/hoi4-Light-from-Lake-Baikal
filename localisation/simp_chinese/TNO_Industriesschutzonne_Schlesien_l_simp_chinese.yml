 HWL_Karl_Hanke:0 "卡尔·汉克"
 POLITICS_Karl_Hanke_DESC:0 "A master with golden rank treading upon lower men of all rank and blood who tried to rise and revolt. Nothing but the clatter of chains, turning of gears, and bellowing of smoke from factories now.\n\nSS-Gruppenführer Karl Hanke finds himself a man of honor, one of justice and virtue, yet dons nothing but the wills of the industrial magnates, as well as the guns of mercenaries willing to carry it out. Fired in his early 20's for joining the NSDAP, Hanke embraced the role of an orator and organizer by talent, and managed to slowly, yet surely, climb his way through the administrative positions of the Reich, even managing to achieve relations with high-ranking figures such as Erwin Rommel, the soon-to-be-late Joseph Goebbels, and even Albert Speer himself. Nevertheless, as the dawning of Axis victory appeared on the horizon, Hanke never allowed his ambition one step back.\n\nThus began the glory days of the Reich, the days in which the Americans backed off, the French and British were conquered, the Russians were a mere thought upon the hills, and the world became the cornucopia upon which Germany feasted. The Hangman of Breslau put away his rifle, and instead chose the champagne glass, looking to grow his portfolio as greatly as possible as his eyes fell upon the stars.\n\nBut every Titan must suffer a fall most terrible. The economy fell, the West Russian War fell, the Reich itself fell, and one thousand years of promised ascension fell within the span of just short of two decades. Hanke coordinated with his good friend, Albert Speer, in navigating the survival of as many of the other Speerites as possible. However, whilst the cannon shots echo above, Hanke rules from below, collaborating with all of the industrial magnates in an effort to secure their work efforts, while watching every corner's shadow for a slave revolt's march upon their borders...and for every leader who may ally with such degenerate rebels..."
 ISS_back_to_work:0 "回去工作！"
 ISS_back_to_work_desc:0 "德国正在崩溃，而身处其间的西里西亚之中，人们还在继续他们的日常工作生活，似乎没有发生任何改变。日出进厂上班，日落离厂下班。星期日休息一天，星期一又回到工作。在这种内部斗争中，我们不能犹豫，回去工作吧！"
 ISS_slave_repression:0 "镇压奴隶"
 ISS_slave_repression_desc:0 "西里西亚的工业巨头们简直被普鲁士发生的事情吓坏了。如果西里西亚也发生一场奴隶暴动，并且像普鲁士那样失去控制，那巨头们所建立的一切都将毁灭，汉克所建立的一切都将毁灭。必须让奴隶搞清楚自己的处境，他们应该在富得流油的德国主人的皮靴下做牛做马，而如果他们不答应，等待着他们的将是黑洞洞的枪口。"
