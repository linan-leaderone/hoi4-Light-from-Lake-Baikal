 POLITICS_COUNCILURG_DESC: "全国执政委员会，简称“委员会”，是何塞·巴特列-奥多涅斯基于瑞士联邦委员会而缔造的行政机构。巴特列认为，乌拉圭若不由总统，而是由一个权力分散的行政机构统治，那么独裁政权就永远不会出现。\n\n然而在巴特列派获得红党领导权后，红党便四分五裂，而保守派也对巴特列的改革表示不满。于是，巴特列派只能达成妥协：总统一职不会随着委员会的成立而废止，两者将共享行政权力。这一局面没能维持下去，加夫列尔·特拉总统废除了委员会并成为了独裁者。\n\n三月政权倒台后，乌拉圭实现了民主化，巴特列派终于能如巴特列所愿，在1952年重启委员会制。然而，委员会并没能使国家受益。相反，全国执政委员会在国务上总是拖泥带水，让民众苦恼无比。国会长期就废除委员会、恢复总统制的议题辩论，但一直得不出什么结果。根据乌拉圭宪法，只有在选举当天就获得35%的得票，修宪公投才有可能生效。民族党右派认为，这个标准就算满足得了，也要花很长时间。因此，政治家们开始探索§O用另类、极端的措施废除委员会§!。\n\n正如§R某人§!所言：“只要这委员会还在，不出五年§W白党§!就会胜选，不出十五年§s军方就会政变§!。”\n\n但愿事情不会到那个地步吧。"
 POLITICS_AMILCAR_VASCONCELLOS_DESC: "A common criticism of Batllists is that they treat their ideology like a religion, being dogmatic about it and refusing to compromise. Vasconcellos might be the best representation of this trope, because his unwavering defense of the Colegiado has made what should have been an easy road to power into a rocky one.\n\nBorn in Artigas, the young Vasconcellos moved to Montevideo to receive his higher education. He became an elementary school teacher, developing a permanent and unwavering vocation to serve in the field of education, beginning to teach in 1938.\n\nHis time in Montevideo also saw him getting into politics, as the young Vasconcellos was a witness of Terra's coup and the Marzist dictatorship. He ended up as another opponent to it, participating in protests. This activity saw him getting in contact with Luis Batlle, with whom he would develop a friendship, becoming one of the \"Young Turks\", Luis' followers. Vasconcellos involvement in Quincista politics saw him becoming the director of Acción, the lema's newspaper, the Minister of Livestock and then the Minister of Finance. It ended becoming obvious that he would be the heir of Luis after he passed away, but his defense of the Colegiado even after it was proved to be failing the country put his position in jeopardy, as he was almost defeated by Jorge Batlle in a primary.\n\nHe managed to defeat that challenge, but orthodox Batllism lies split between his own followers, the Frente Colorado de Unidad who supported the UCB and Michelini's lista 99. And Vasconcellos knows that Jorge is observing the situation from the shadows, waiting for his moment to strike. If he hopes to live up to Luis' legacy, he will have to find a way of governing well and reuniting Batllism under his command."
 POLITICS_MANUEL_FLORES_MORA_DESC: "Maybe Flores Mora is more suitable as a member of the Council than as President of Uruguay, but the electorate has spoken in favor of the restoration of the presidency and so he shall serve them as one.\n\nA relative of the infamous 19th century dictator Venancio Flores, Manuel \"Maneco\" Flores Mora was born in 1923. He quickly showed a gift for the written word as he began to write and take interest in literary works. Being influenced by writers like the Uruguayan Juan Carlos Onetti and the Spanish José Bergamín, Flores Mora was part of the Generation of '45, a group of artists, mainly writers, who worked in the context of the growing urbanization of Montevideo and others cities from the Interior\n\nAs is a common occurrence in Uruguay, Flores Mora entered politics thanks to journalism. His uncle landed him a job in El Diario, which he traded later for a job in Marcha. Writing on it, he managed to catch the attention of Luis Batlle Berres, who considered that the young man had potential. Maneco accepted Luis' offer to work in Acción, becoming one of the \"Young Turks\". Soon enough he found himself elected as a deputy in 1954, managing to be reelected in 1958.\n\nIn the fight between Vasconcellos and the clique of Abdala and Jorge Batlle for the control of the lista 15, Flores Mora, as a collegialist, was one of Vasconcellos main backers, to the point of being considered his second in command. It wasn't a surprise then that he was chosen as a candidate for the 1966 elections as a reward to his service and loyalty. The only surprise is him being the President and not the President of the Council, but Maneco appears to be able to deal with the situation fate put in his hands."
 POLITICS_JORGE_BATLLE_DESC: "History doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes. The true heir to the legacy of José Batlle y Ordoñez was his nephew, Luis, because his sons turned to the right-wing and became conservatives. And now something similar has happened to Luis, because his son Jorge is a liberal.\n\nBorn to a loving father that wanted to give to his sons what he never had, Jorge spent part of his childhood abroad, as the Marzist government forced Luis and his family into exile. Returning when things calmed down, Jorge started his political career on radio Ariel, working with a cousin of his during the electoral campaign of 1946, eventually ending up working on his father's newspaper, Acción. All these experiences taught him about the art of politics, and he finally entered them in 1958, when he was elected as a deputy for Montevideo.\n\nHowever, by that point Jorge had developed his own political leanings, distancing himself from his father's beliefs. While Luis maintained that he did nothing wrong after the crisis of the 50s and that the system the Batllists had built was fine, Jorge started to have doubts. He happened to have an Argentinian girlfriend at the time, and visiting her one day, he decided to attend a conference that the Austrian economists Hayek and Mises were giving. There Jorge discovered his love for free market economics, which would prove to last longer than his relationship.\n\nThe death of his father opened the window for opportunity for him and his liberal vision to take control of the lista 15. And he succeeded at it certainly, but he had to lie. He presented himself as a developmentalist, because he knew that was the further the lema would accept. But now that he is the President he will have to face the problem that will define his career: how much can he get away with turning a left-wing group to the right-wing?"
 POLITICS_OSCAR_GESTIDO_DESC: "Of all the military men who began their careers in the Marzist era, Óscar Gestido is among those who had no fascist sympathies and only did as they were told, remaining apolitical during the period.\n\nGestido always loved the air force, beginning his military career with the goal of becoming a pilot. And he did, flying a single-engine biplane from Montevideo to Asunción in 1926 as part of the official Uruguayan delegation to a Paraguayan commemoration. But that wouldn't be the end of his story, as Gestido kept climbing the ranks, being appointed in 1938 as the General Director of Military Aeronautics, being promoted to General in 1949 and finally serving as the General Inspector of the Army in 1951. During his tenure the air force was officially created as an independent branch, an event Gestido took great pride in.\n\nAfter retiring, his resume spoke of a trustable military man, as so he was appointed as the Auditor President of the AFE, from which Gestido earned a reputation of being a good administrator who knew how to balance a budget. But it wouldn't be until the 1959 floods, and his appointment as President of the National Commission for Aid to the Victims, that a legend was made. The Uruguayan public saw in Gestido an honest man who worked hard into ensuring the victims were given the aid they deserved. Unsurprisingly, politicians soon began knocking on his door.\n\nNow as President Gestido faces many challenges, he is a self-declared leftists that leads the right-wing of the Colorado Party and wants to ensure Charlone's influence is minimal while maintaining the unity of the party. And then is the task of actually ruling the nation. Gestido works hard, but he might find himself in front of a machine he doesn't understand, not knowing which button to press."
 POLITICS_OSCAR_GESTIDO_SAD_DESC: "The efforts of the Blancos to politicize the military in its favor had been denounced by Gestido, who stated that \"every country that §Rpoliticizes§! its §garmed forces§! becomes another of the §Bsad examples§! that proliferate on the Continent\". But he was not heard, and the country paid for it.\n\nThe government of the Supreme Court tried its best, but lawyers were just not made to lead the nation in the aftermath of a coup sponsored by a foreign power with whom the ruling treacherous government collaborated. A new solution needed to be found, the nation required strong leadership. And so, the people began to look up to their heroes, and they found one in which they wanted to believe in: Óscar Diego Gestido, made a legend thanks to his work in the 1959 floods.\n\nNow, Gestido was the last to be convinced in what was a campaign to draft him to the Residencia de Suárez. Certainly, Vasconcellos believed in him, after his own bid was rejected, but Gestido could prove to be the impartial man the country needed and that Vasconcellos failed to be. He only needed to be convinced of it, and so Blancos and Colorados worked together to convince the retired general to serve his country one last time.\n\nEventually he ceded, accepting to wear the presidential band. Now the new President of Uruguay has a hard task, protecting its democracy from both the external enemy that wants to extinguish it, and the growing internal anger that calls for justice to be administered to the traitors. But he is not alone at this task, he has the help of a national unity cabinet whose pillars are Vasconcellos and Tejera. And in the army, he has the support of Pereira and the rising star that is Seregni. With all of them working together, it is feasible for a happy ending to this situation being found.\n\n§YRight?§!"
 POLITICS_OSCAR_GESTIDO_MARZIST_DESC: "Óscar Gestido is a man haunted by his past. For he in 1935 was a pilot, and the then Mayor was among those who spotted the rebel camp of Basilio Muñoz, located in \"La Picada de los Ladrones\", in the Negro River. The revolutionary leader was eating with his 500 hundred men, and the smog of the fires they used to cook revealed them. The camp was bombarded, and despite what rumors might have said, Gestido didn't take part in it, his task was reconnaissance. By that point the revolution was already defeated, but that was the final nail to the coffin.\n\nGestido didn't reflect on it, until the Motincito happened in 1938 and he saw how the Marzist regime turned more authoritarian and fascist-friendly. As he began to develop his left-wing leanings, he realized the mistake he had made by fighting for the government. He had the chance of joining a patriotic crusade and didn't, instead he chose to fight for those who were cozy with the Germans, those who were ravaging Europe and most importantly, England. Sure, he could use the excuse of \"obediencia debida\" to not feel bad about himself, but the truth is that he was not brave enough. Lopez Silveira showed a generation of young soldiers how someone can do the good fight despite adversity.\n\nSo, when Gestido got word that the democratic opposition was talking about preparing an incursion to free Uruguay, he decided to volunteer for it. He quickly was named as its leader, thanks to his military experience and his heroic statues for his work aiding the victims of the 1959 floods. Now in victory his name might carry the same weight as those of heroes like Leandro Gómez, but the old General can only worry about whether he did enough to cleanse the sins of his past."
 POLITICS_SUPREME_CORTE_DE_JUSTICIA_DESC: "Article 150 of the Uruguayan constitution of 1952: \"The §YConsejo Nacional de Gobierno§! is made up of nine members directly elected by the people, together with double the number of alternates, for a term of four years, with the guarantees and in accordance with the rules established for voting in Section III, considering the Republic as a single electoral constituency\".\n\nArticle 155: \"If on the date on which the Consejo Nacional de Gobierno§! is to assume its functions, the new National Councilors who must integrate it have not yet been proclaimed, the §MCorte Suprema de Justicia§! will provisionally perform those functions in the meantime\".\n\nWhile in theory this would mean that the Corte Suprema should have only taken power after the first of march of 1965, the fact that the elected Herrerist-Ruralist council had collaborated with Aguerrondo, and worse, Juan Domingo Perón, meant that the mostly Colorado-controlled military wanted to speed up the process while maintaining the legalist tradition that had distinguished Uruguay from the other Latin American countries. And so, the Corte Suprema was handed over the executive power after all the Nationalists councilors and their alternates were kicked out.\n\nThere are those who fear that the Corte Suprema is not up to the challenge of having to rule a nation that has to recover from a foreign-backed coup attempt and that is entering into another §gGrey Scare§!, and they might be right, but in times like these, all are called to serve their country regardless of status or capabilities."
 POLITICS_JORGE_PACHECO_ARECO_DESC: "A politician described by the American embassy as \"a man with a good heart but not very bright and probably unable to take leadership after the death of César\" doesn't inspire too much trust. And to be fair, that is the general reaction of the public, but nevertheless Pacheco was the man Gestido chose, and so he is the President of Uruguay.\n\nPacheco was born in 1920 as the son and grandson of politicians. He was the son of the doctor and deputy Manuel Pacheco, who was related to José Batlle y Ordoñez, since his father was the brother of Batlle's wife. His maternal grandfather was Ricardo Areco, a Vierists, and Pacheco decided to follow in his footsteps by becoming one. It would prove to be a bad choice, as Vierism, stuck between Batllism, Riverism and Sosism quickly died out because of its irrelevance. And some Vierists, like Eduardo Blanco Acevedo, became Marzists.\n\nPerhaps in another life Pacheco could have ended as one of Charlone's lackeys, but lucky for his future political career he was friends with Raumar Jade and knew his family. The father of his friend, Raúl, suggested to Pacheco that he should use his family connections with the Batlles in order to get a job in \"El Día\", the Batllists newspaper, Pacheco realized that it was a good opportunity, and so he took the advice and ended up as a reporter. He wrote articles that supported the candidacy of Gestido, and soon enough he obtained enough prestige to be a candidate for deputy and senator.\n\nThe path to the presidency was an accidental one, Gestido and the other high-profile members of the UCB wouldn't resign from the Council in order to run, the General's friends refused the offer of being President and a candidate was needed before Charlone could use the lack of one as an advantage to nominate someone loyal to him. In the end Pacheco was chosen and elected. His detractor says that he is a dull man, but whether this is true or not, Pachecho will need to prove it during his presidency."
 POLITICS_MARTIN_ECHEGOYEN_DESC: "For a man who was called \"the most intelligent man at the service of the caudillo Herrera\", Echegoyen quickly went against his mentor's wishes by maintaining the alliance with the Ruralists and cooling down the anti-Americanism of the Herrerists. But perhaps it was his own intelligence that told him that he should go against what Herrera wanted if it proved beneficial to him.\n\nEchegoyen's political life began not where you would expect from the leader of the main wing of Herrerism, as in his young days he was part of the Partido Blanco Radical, a left-wing and anti-Herrerist split of the National Party. It was not to last however, because Echegoyen changed his mind and threw his weight behind Herrera, which proved good to his career, as Echegoyen won his trust and subsequently landed a job as a minister of the Terrist cabinet. His participation in the Marzist regime wouldn't end just there, as Echegoyen negotiated with Germany the funding for the Rincón del Bonete dam, an activity that saw him traveling to the Third Reich and meeting Adolf Hitler himself, who condecorated him with the Nazi golden eagle.\n\nSince then, Echegoyen has been called a fascist. His alliance with the Ruralists made him and his followers more amicable to the US, which reduced the weight behind this line of attack. However, it was a betrayal of what Herrera believed in, and it was felt when the orthodox Herrerist won a considerable number of votes in the 1962 elections, enough to scare Echegoyen and made him realize something had to be done.\n\nThe road ahead became clear then, to consolidate his position he had to beat them at their own game. The prize, if he is successful, is to have full control of the Herrerist movement and pass to history as a worthy successor of Herrera and as a great caudillo.\n\nOf course, the Americans might have a say on his plans."
 POLITICS_ALBERTO_GALLINAL_HEBER_DESC: "Alberto Gallinal Heber had everything in life to do what he wanted. He could have been a painter, pianist, perhaps an opera singer, a notable tribune, writer and poet, performer, prestigious lawyer and who knows how many more things. But no, he preferred to be a servant and fight against misery, hunger, illiteracy and disease. He fixed hospitals, built schools, houses, cut thorns, bagged locusts and dug ditches. And now he is the President of Uruguay.\n\nThe fourth son of Alejandro Gallinal, a noteworthy rancher and politician in the times of Batlle y Ordoñez, Gallinal Heber found himself managing his family lands before joining the ARU. He stood out in the organization for his work on horse breeding and in fighting mange and foot-and-mouth disease, and soon he found himself as the President of the Florida chapter, having made a name for himself. Later he formally joined politics and was among the founders of the Unión Blanca y Democrática in 1956, being a candidate to the Council in 1958 but failing to be elected.\n\nIn the meantime, he continued to carry out his characteristic philanthropic work, being part of the National Commission for Aid to the Victims presided by Gestido, directing the construction of new premises for rural schools, the remodeling of the Pereira Rossell Hospital maternity and the Maciel hospital, among other notable things. As always, he kept his involvement in politics, and in 1964, feeling that the UBD was corrupt, ineffective and soft on trade unionism, he and a few others split to create their own sector, the Movimiento Nacional de Rocha, condemning the UBD to death.\n\nOf course, the MNR by its own couldn't be elected, even with Gallinal Heber as their candidate, so a coalition with a UBD remnant, the Reconstrucción Blanca, was formed. They managed to win in the end, but now they have to keep their coalition together if Gallinal Heber hopes to continue his work."
 POLITICS_JUAN_PEDRO_RIBAS_MARZIST_DESC: "Ribas was just one of the many conservative military men in the Marzist regime, loyal Uruguayan patriots and ardent supporters of the Spanish nationalists. His loyalty to the regime was well rewarded, earning him a chance to meet his idol Franco and a spot as general. His tenure in this post was short as the Batllist demagogues soon seized control of his country, seeing fit to accuse him of being an Argentinean traitor, humiliating him by suggesting he would ever betray his dear Uruguay, a grave insult to his honor that would force him to resign.\n\nAn admirer of Eduardo Blanco Acevedo, he joined his movement after Marzism's demise. New life would be breathed into his career thanks to the politics of compromise in a move that got him into government as a man responsible for preventing coups for the people who labeled him a coup plotter. His tensions with Luis Batlle quickly grew into a macho affair where Ribas left the government and dueled Luis. This made him a darling of the far-right who Ribas would claim to the press, begged him to coup the government, something he would refuse out of a lack of desire to act as a tutor to his nation.\n\nClearly, Ribas has changed his mind. The Colegiado was an evil that Marzists fought before to defeat in 1933. When Charlone offered him the chance to finish their duty and restore order as interim president until new elections could be held, Ribas could not refuse. Yet now he finds himself in a familiar position under Charlone, a condescending paternalism like that he experienced under Luis, Ribas can only wonder if he is getting the respect he deserves."
 POLITICS_JUAN_PEDRO_RIBAS_FALANGIST_DESC: "Above all else, Ribas is loyal to Uruguay. He dutifully served in the military under the Marzist regime and would have continued to do so under Luis Batlle had he not been tarred and feathered by him with accusations of acting as a lap dog for the Argentines, any man with a shred of honor would have resigned the same as he did.\n\nRibas' entry into the government would prove to be as quick as his departure, despising the paternalistic attitude Luis regarded with, topping off his exit with a duel between himself and Luis. This macho exhibition would win him the love of the far-right who he would claim that they tried to beg him to coup the government, rejecting these pleas out of a lack of desire to act as a tutor to his nation. His fame would earn him an invite to join Aguerrondo's coup only to defect when the plotter enlisted Argentine help, proving himself to be a Perónist stooge.\n\nThis situation forced Ribas to create his own paramilitary - Defensa Armada Nacionalista - to assist in defeating the coup. The takeover was prevented but the porteños, the eternal enemies of the Orientals could not accept this, leading to Perón's retaliation. Uruguayan women and children lie dead on the streets in the wake of the Platinean Blitz for daring not to follow Buenos Aires. The Oriental people cry out for each traitor to be hanged on a Montevideo lamppost for their evils. Ribas has been propelled to power by these desires for vengeance, offering the worried people the promise they desire:\n\n§V¡Uruguayos, nunca más!§!"
 POLITICS_MARIO_OSCAR_AGUERRONDO_DESC: "Certainly, Mario Óscar Aguerrondo is not the first military man who desired to coup the Uruguayan government, and neither is he the first to have answered Benito Nardone's call for a coup to solve the Colegiado problem, but he is the first to have succeeded in the 20th century, managing to be left as the ruler of the nation in the aftermath.\n\nOne might ask what his motivation is; for starters, Aguerrondo is a Herrerist, and thus, at least in principle, an enemy of Batllism and everything it stands for. And like so many hardliners, not only in Herrerism but in the Uruguayan right in general, he believes that Batllism is either socialistic or communistic, or that it is a proxy for communists who want to destroy the country, and so it has to be purged if not outright destroyed. This opposition towards the legacy of Batlle and to the red menace was not unknown; it was precisely the reason why Nardone appointed him as the Police Chief of Montevideo. He was not ready for the position, but he learned to use it to build up his future military career. Attaining the rank of General, he defeated the opposition that watched his rise with worry thanks to his unsubtle fascist-sympathies.\n\nHis sympathies for fascism are precisely the reason for why one could make the mistake, at least in his eyes, of calling him a fascist. It matters not that many of the members of the coalition of forces that allowed his coup either admire Hitler, Mussolini, Franco or Perón. For Aguerrondo all those are foreign ideologies; he is just a Uruguayan nationalist, an Artiguist.\n\nWould Artigas support what Aguerrondo is about to do? He certainly believes that is the case, and it is not like anyone can convince him of the contrary, given that they will soon be in prison or dead."
 POLITICS_PABLO_MORATORIO_DESC: "The story of Pablo Moratorio goes back to 1938, when he was just a colonel in the army. His brother Saúl was involved with the Motincito, and Moratorio knew it would happen. Allegedly he informed the authorities of the plot, although the truthfulness of this statement is highly questionable. In any case, he benefited from it thanks to his brother. When Moratorio became a general in the 40s he was known as a Marzist general, enjoying the protection of Blanco Acevedo and Charlone when democracy was restored in 1946.\n\nHis allegiance to the National Party made the Blancos appoint him as the Director of the Frigorífico Nacional upon their electoral victory in 1958, which proved good for Moratorio as his face became known in the Interior, which made him a valuable ally for putschists in the army. For a time, they believed that Moratorio would be the man who would grant them their desired junta, but he has failed them. Before being an ideological plotter, he is an opportunist. Moratorio would have no problems joining a cause only to abandon it if he saw it was to fail. His most sacred value is to seek his personal safety and well-being.\n\nWith Ribas removed thanks to his attempt to turn his interim position to a permanent one, Charlone needed to nominate a President who would have the support of the nationalistic or putschist sectors of the now legalist-purged army. And Moratorio was up to the job. Unlike Ribas, he is happy to play his part, only demanding to be paid for it."

He was skeptical of requesting his aid to carry out Aguerrondo's coup, but at the time he let his doubts go since external help was needed to carry it out successfully. It proved to be a mistake however, given that as Moratorio feared, Aguerrondo began to increasingly get closer to Perón. Fearful of the Colonel finally obtaining what he wanted: the subjugation of Uruguay, Moratorio removed the man he helped install. Now he rules at his place, and given that no announcement confirming that elections would be called in 1966 was made, it seems Moratorio hopes to secure his seat."
 POLITICS_VENTURA_RODRIGUEZ_DESC: "There is a lot of cynicism around the concept of \"necessary evil\". Many men use it as an excuse to commit all the sins their hearts desire. But Ventura Rodríguez is different. He is one of the few who sincerely knows that what he has done is wrong, but that he had to do it regardless. He won't ask for forgiveness; he only wants to finish a job that is already done so he can go home.\n\nBy himself Rodríguez was of little note, but his affiliation with the National Party made him an attractive asset to Aguerrondo, who welcomed Rodríguez into his personal fiefdom: the Montevideo Police. Soon they became close and Rodríguez became a person in which Aguerrondo could trust to run things once he had to go, either by promotion or by the Colorados kicking him out. As such, Rodríguez was one of Aguerrondo's close allies by the time his coup came to be.\n\nAnd they triumphed, and the Republic was saved from the Batllist demagogy that was the Colegiado, but Rodríguez then became aware of a bigger threat to Uruguay: the refusal of Aguerrondo and his loyalists to let go. To his horror, he realized that unlike him, his comrades-in-arms didn't desire the return of liberal democracy, and perhaps, any democracy at all.\n\nStruck by this realization and afraid of becoming a second Baldomir in the eyes of history, he began to plot. And when Moratorio decided that Aguerrondo had to go, Rodríguez offered him the forces of the Minister of the Interior. But Rodríguez was not a fool, he knew that Moratorio would have to be forced out as well, and so it was done when he was sufficiently prepared.

After the resignation of Alberto Gallinal Heber from the intendancy in 1951, Harrison took over as his alternate. Afterwards he was one of the founders and most important leaders of the Federal Ruralist Action League.

The Republic was world renowned for its dedication to civic virtue and the idea of a progressive democracy, but those illusions were shattered through the smoke of guns and the spilling of innocent blood.\n\nThere are those who refuse to admit this truth, but they know they are lying to themselves. Some of them still try to do the good fight through the proper channels: political participation, demonstrations, all the things that made Batlle smile. But there are those who wonder if those who shall not be named speak the truth.

Why had they dared to dream? Because Batlle sold them into a lie? What fools they were.\n\nOf course, foreigns or subversive actors could always be blamed for the current situation, but the truth is far too obvious to be able to be hidden. It is as Rivera said, the Orientals have never known as many bad days as they have since they became independent. They collapsed the country on their own, they have nobody else to point their fingers to but the mirrors in which their reflection awaits them. Isn't it fitting that the national hero is Artigas? A broke, betrayed man who died in exile far away from home, with everyone in his homeland having forgotten and moved from him.\n\n§xThe Dream is dead, perhaps forever.§!"

 POLITICS_WILSON_FERREIRA_ALDUNATE_DESC: "Wilson Ferreira Aldunate's enemies call him a sophist. Others claim that his \"relentless voice\" and \"good looks\" have \"wrought havoc on several generations of women\". But Blancos look on him as the hope of a new generation of their party.\n\nWilson doesn't use the word, but people call him a progressive. This seems strange to some—he's a Blanco, a National Party man; he should be a conservative through and through, should he not? But only fools doubt that his ideological dissent from the PN renders him ashamed of his Blanco background. He got it from his family. Though Wilson Ferreira Aldunate's birthplace is actually the town of José Batlle y Ordoñez, the birth certificate records it as Nico Pérez some distance away—for his family would sooner die than let the newborn's records be contaminated by the name of a Colorado.\n\nWilson's loyalty to the National Party should not be interpreted as blind tolerance for its evils. In his youth, Wilson was a Herrerist—but Herrera's faithlessness led Wilson and his family to defect to the Partido Nacional Independiente. Under Carlos Quijano's wise mentorship, Wilson began his political life, fought against Marzism, and supported the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War.\n\nTime passed. The early 60s knew him as Ferreira, a loyal liberal conservative except for his endorsement of land reform—for which his fellow ranchers called him a class traitor. But the end of that decade saw him become Wilson, warrior against corruption, defender of public liberties—for in those years the man had come to realise that Uruguay needed deep reform. Leftists heard him talk and cheered, 'blancos baratos' condemned him; in the end it mattered not. When Wilson spoke to the Nation of the destruction of corruption, land reform, and the nationalisation of banks, conservatives and left-wingers united to put him in the Residencia de Suárez.\n\nThe new President raises the standards under which the late Aparicio Saravia once stood: free elections and administrative honesty. Saravia succeeded in death—the question now is whether Wilson will succeed in life."
