 nor_light_of_the_reich: "日耳曼帝国之光"
 nor_light_of_the_reich_desc: "位于大日耳曼国最北端的挪威专员辖区，可谓是日耳曼尼亚治下的领地中的一盏明灯。在约瑟夫·特博文专员和居尔布兰·伦德总理的精心管理下，挪威这个民族国家的经济和社会地位比其战前相比改善了许多。我们的稳定足以向我们的主子们证明北欧-雅利安人种的优越性，因为我们已成了德国机器中的一个重要齿轮，而没有我们，大日耳曼国就什么也不是，我们是他们最大的理论和经济资产。"
 nor_tackling_civil_disobedience: "应对民众骚乱"
 nor_tackling_civil_disobedience_desc: "Two decades following the establishment and legitimization of our regime those whom resist our mandate of governance continue to cause issues for society as a whole. Regardless of the continually favourable social and economic situation the state finds itself in. Those who foolishly wish to disrupt the workable authoritative model of, the 'Führerprinzip', have begun an unexpected and ferocious campaign of disobedience and passive resistance against governing powers at-be. As a result, methods of countering said rise in disobedient passivism will be enacted by the state, to protect the majority whom wisely align with our national goals."
 nor_search_the_underground: "搜寻地下组织"
 nor_search_the_underground_desc: "Regardless of our attempts to brutally suppress the 'Milorg', who dare challenge our rightful mandate of governance, the Bolshevik swine continue to undermine our regime through acts of intelligence gathering, sabotage, raids and espionage. Yet, seemingly simple act of detention cannot be applied in this circumstance, as the group operates under a cloud of anonymity. However, our unquestionably loyal informats who reside in the nation's proverbial underground have identified a potential area of group occupation. As a result of such information, we shall merecessely sweep societies underbelly till we locate these traitorous elements who continue to act counter to the wishes of society."
 nor_close_the_swedish_border: "关闭瑞典边境"
 nor_close_the_swedish_border_desc: "The tumour of representative democracy continues to deface the European continent, regardless of the Großgermanisches Reich's astonishing triumph, as the Kingdom of Sweden remains intact. Since the establishment of our regime decades ago, anti-government subversives have exploited our seemingly lackluster authority on the vast Norway-Sweden border. These subversive operatives have been able to illegally invade our borders with relative comfort, conduct their pathetic activities, and then cowardly flee back into Swedish territory. To protect the nation's citizenry from the fear of terrorism, we have no choice but to permanently close and militarize our border with Sweden, thus damaging the operational capabilities of the resistance."
 nor_enforcing_german_literacy: "强化德语教学"
 nor_enforcing_german_literacy_desc: "The 'Reichskommissariat' was envisioned as the transitional phases for the future incorporation of various Germanic countries outside pre-war Germany into an expanded Nazi state. Yet, this process of formal integration into the Reich can only commence once we have successfully 'Germanized' the population. As a result, in order to strengthen our ties to the Reich and hasten our eventual integration, we shall implement legislation which shall force Germanisation amongst the citizenry of the nation. Yet, we must start relatively slow, at least by our standards. Therefore, our first act will be to enforce German literacy among the populuous to better prepare them for impending integration and life directly under the German boot."
 nor_phasing_out_norwegian: "德国-挪威历史渊源"
 nor_phasing_out_norwegian_desc: "To encourage further support for administrative integration into the Großgermanisches Reich, we must convince the population that we and the German people are one in the same. Now, how will we accomplish said goals? Simple! By placing greater emphasis on 'history', at least our doctored version that is. By informing the population of the great and wonderful historical stories of cooperation and friendship between Germans and Norwegians over the centuries, will hopefully be able to convince those who are perhaps somewhat opposed to our plan of proper integration into the Reich by showing the loving and gentle relationship between our two peoples."
 nor_disadvantage_the_disobedient: "削弱悖逆者"
 nor_disadvantage_the_disobedient_desc: "As a means of encouraging support among the population for integration, we must send a clear message to those who dare oppose our mandate to change. To sway the citizenry, we'll exploit human psychology. Regardless of race and inferiority, all humans strive to make the most of their pitiful existence and achieve happiness through high social standing and good living conditions. Therefore, those who are unwise enough to oppose us will be disadvantaged by the government, indirectly resulting in a loss of motivation and increasing of docile characteristics of obedience as those affected will only reclaim what they have achieved through the acceptance of eventual integration. Thereby improving conformity among the citizenry, who desire to maintain what they have worked for."
 nor_the_future_of_the_working_class: "工人阶级的未来"
 nor_the_future_of_the_working_class_desc: "For centuries the Norwegian working class has been made up primarily by those who are more agriculturally inclined, as agrarian traditionalist thought has permeated throughout these ancient nordic plains for time untold. However, our continued adherence to traditionalist economic principles has left Reichskommissariat Norwegen suffering from a severe lack of industry. Yet, regardless of thought, some pragmatic government officials have suggested our administration begin training the latest generation of farmers to adapt to more mechanical methods of production, ultimately integrating them into the potential future industrial complexes that may one-day dominate Norway's landscape. However, many traditionalists within the government have noted that the abandonment of agrarian-based working class alignments is a direct betrayal of the National Socialist ideology, thus resulting in significant resistance from our loyal rural constituents. But ultimately, neither-side has yet yielded to the other."
 nor_mandatory_transportation: "交通管制"
 nor_mandatory_transportation_desc: "To truly embrace National Socialist philosophy, we must continue to discourage any form of individualism in our citizenry, as the concept of the individual poses a great risk to the collective. Although this may seem ever so slightly overkill even for our regime, the usage of personal transportation is a danger to the stability of the collective, therefore it must be banned. Furthermore, by enforcing the usage of governmental transportation to places of work it will increase the state's capability to observe its citizens, thus potentially allowing for us to gain more influence over the minds of our countrymen."
 nor_tracking_when_youre_on_and_off: "严查上下班"
 nor_tracking_when_youre_on_and_off_desc: "With our implementation of mandatory government transportation, it has allowed our intelligence services to more effectively monitor our citizens. However, we should go a step further... to ensure proper societal cohesion and order, it's been suggested that we should take those whom happen to act somewhat suspicious into protective custody. Yet, what constitutes suspicious behavior? Well, those who choose to take an alternative route to their workplace shall be investigated and placed into custody, which seems extremely fair! By introducing more draconian laws for mild offenses we will be able to better track our citizen's actions and ensure that nobody is willingly breaking the law."
 nor_on_the_topic_of_illegal_media: "非法媒体问题"
 nor_on_the_topic_of_illegal_media_desc: "Illegal media has always been an issue facing the Großgermanisches Reich and its Reichskommissariats, as those whom happen to dislike our regime continue to pointlessly spread anti-government propaganda, simply attempting to diminish our power and weaken social cohesion. In these trying times, we mustn't allow anyone to negatively impact society via the spread of illicit media. Therefore, with regard to the topic of illegal media, we must devote a greater number of resources to combating the spread of these highly dangerous and damaging pieces of media for the sake of the state."
 nor_gain_traction_on_crackdowns: "镇压加剧"
 nor_gain_traction_on_crackdowns_desc: "To halt the spread of these illegal media publications, we must aim for the head, proverbially decapitating, or cutting, the supply routes used to distribute these materials throughout our nation. Only through means of authoritarianism and brutalism can we hope to protect Reichskommissariat Norwegen from these dangerous and illicit materials being spread by such degenerate forces who unfortunately find themselves at home in our proud nation. We in the government are quite sure that, hopefully, through means brutal suppression we shall unite the Norwegian citizenry with us in a crusade against subversive materials. Hopefully, our prediction is accurate and our suppressive methods will prove successful..."
 nor_doing_goebbels_proud: "让戈培尔骄傲"
 nor_doing_goebbels_proud_desc: "Although regrettably Reichsminister Dr. Goebbels is no longer with us, we must ensure his legacy lives on, at least in Reichskommissariat Norwegen that is! To halt the spread of illegal media, perhaps we should take a page from Goebbels's book of successful propaganda. According to Dr. Goebbels, propaganda shouldn't include overt political messaging, instead, it should be subtle yet effective. By employing this method, he converted millions to National-Socialism and revolutionised cinema. Therefore, to reinvigorate our media, we must employ Goebbels's methods of propaganda to ensure the Norwegian citizenry remain loyal to our government, they must be properly entertained. As a result, it's best we follow Goebbels's previously successful methods of propaganda. Thereby doing Dr. Goebbels proud and ensuring his legacy carries on whilst saving Norwegian cinema from a decline into degeneracy."
 nor_redistribute_the_forces: "重新配置部队"
 nor_redistribute_the_forces_desc: "In order to successfully strike against this illicit media being imported into our nation, it's been suggested that we must redistribute our forces so that we can better monitor what is being imported into Reichskommissariat Norwegen from abroad. As it's been determined that the majority of said illicit materials seem to have been brought in from abroad, not from the nation-state itself. Thereby, we can only hope that our increased presence in areas with which illicit materials are smuggled through will lessen their import into our nation."
 nor_find_a_more_fitting_cause: "寻找更恰当的用途"
 nor_find_a_more_fitting_cause_desc: "It seems as if our redistribution of forces to assist in the prevention of the import of illegal and illicit media into nation has been unsuccessful, as many who have taken part in the operation have received few orders and have suffered from a lack of morale given their menial task of observance and security. Therefore, it's time we find a more fitting cause for these brave servants of Reichskommissariat Norwegen, who do not deserve to be rewarded for their loyal service to the state with pathetic tasks that can be accomplished by regional and local authorities. As a result, it's time we end this current operation and place our men elsewhere."
 nor_justify_it_to_germany: "向德国解释"
 nor_justify_it_to_germany_desc: "As expected, the authorities in Germania have begun to question our recent actions with regard to illegal media in Reichskommissariat Norwegen. Therefore, to avoid any potential diplomatic entanglements which may be detrimental to Norway's standing in the Einheitspakt, we must quickly move to justify our actions to the authorities in Germania. As we're sure once we've fully explained our actions and given proper justification for them, our overlords will understand and support us in our attempts to rid Norway of such harmful materials."
 nor_where_it_happens: "抉择之时"
 nor_where_it_happens_desc: "We are at a significant crossroad in history, a change in policy which may affect our government for decades to come. Despite our somewhat positive economic situation, Reichskommissariat Norwegen has found itself suffering from a lack of industry, especially when compared to our fellow Einheitspakt member states. It's been noted that we will eventually lose our economic relative economic power in the Einheitspakt if we refuse to adapt to the changing times. Yet, for centuries Norway's economy had been built on agrarianism, with generations being brought up as farmers rather than industrial workers, which may result in potential social disunity if we place greater emphasis on industry. However, we are sure that whatever decision we shall take will ultimately be a positive for Norway!"
 nor_maintain_agricultural_dominance: "维持农业优势"
 nor_maintain_agricultural_dominance_desc: "Following a somewhat tumultuous debate among the Provisional Councilors of State, it's been decided that it would be beneficial for Reichskommissariat Norwegen to maintain agricultural dominance, as it's tradition. With this decision, let us hope the predominantly agrarian citizens of the countryside will greater support the government, as we have successfully protected their livelihoods from the wave of industrial expansion currently sweeping throughout the Einheitspakt."
 nor_our_shield_to_famine: "预防饥荒"
 nor_our_shield_to_famine_desc: "By continuing with the status-quo of government support for an agrarian-based economy, we have been able to expand our plentiful farms whilst updating farming technology to ensure food production remains at an efficient level. By doing this, we have safeguarded Reichskommissariat Norwegen from the ever looming worry of potential famine in the nation. Yet, we have built up a proverbial shield against the possibility of famine, and are working towards self-sufficiency from the Großgermanisches Reich in the event that they are unable to support our agriculture."
 nor_revive_the_cities: "重振城市"
 nor_revive_the_cities_desc: "Whilst the countryside has thrived under the agrarian economic model which we have followed for decades, our cities have regrettably suffered due to our adherence to the past traditions. Yet, in our changing world, we mustn't fall behind. Therefore, like the majority of the Einheitspakt, we must begin a full-scale programme of revitalisation in our major cities, expanding our industrial capabilities and maintaining our positive economic situation inside the Einheitspakt."
 nor_from_farms_to_parks: "农场变公园"
 nor_from_farms_to_parks_desc: "With the abandonment of our emphasis on agrarian economic policies, the question of what should occur to the vast amount of farms which dot the map of Reichskommissariat Norwegen has been in debate. At this current time, it's more than likely that we shall convert these farms into recreational parks for the people of our proud nation. Regardless of industrialisation, we must ensure that Norway's natural beauty is protected and conserved, as we must ensure that the quality of life for our citizens remains one of the highest in all of the Einheitspakt."
 nor_report_it_to_germany: "向德国报告"
 nor_report_it_to_germany_desc: "As expected, the authorities in Germania have requested we send a detailed report to them with regard to our current economic direction, and if we have made any changes or not to our current economic plan. Given how we do not desire to make an enemy of our masters, we will report all economic actions we have taken to the Fatherland to ensure that a lapse in diplomatic cordiality doesn't occur, thereby safeguarding our relationship with the Reich whilst keeping them informed, which is especially important to Germania given their future plans for Reichskommissariat Norwegen's full integration into the Großgermanisches Reich."
 nor_an_eye_on_and_provided_by_citizens: "群众的眼线"
 nor_an_eye_on_and_provided_by_citizens_desc: "The somewhat obedient citizenry of Reichskommissariat Norwegen may prove useful to our ability of governance. At the establishment of the Third Reich, German citizens were actively encouraged by the government to play a role in state surveillance, ratting out those whom display forms of wrong-think to the authorities. Yet, despite the seemingly harmful drop in stability in the Fatherland, this system of surveillance has proven successful in identifying those who seek to challenge our governing mandate. Therefore, we shall exploit the loyalty of our citizens to expose and re-educate those who may unfortunately stray from the pack and howl against the status-quo of Fascist/National Socialist domination."
 nor_norwegian_enforcements: "挪威人手"
 nor_norwegian_enforcements_desc: "It's been established that the Norwegian population is indeed loyal and supportive of the current regime. It's only proper that we use this to our advantage, as the average citizen could be seen as far more reliable than the occupiers, for they understand the nation and its people to a far greater degree than we ever will. Therefore, it's been decided that the Norwegian citizenry will be the ones to enforce our new guidelines, rather than us Germans."
 nor_german_enforcements: "德国人手"
 nor_german_enforcements_desc: "It's been established that the Norwegian population is indeed loyal and supportive of the current regime. However, it's clear to us that regardless of this supposed loyalty the populus are not to be trusted with such delicate matters, for the average citizen may dislike having to enforce certain rather authoritarian policies upon their friends and family. Therefore, it's only proper that we task us Germans with enforcing our new regime guidelines, rather than the Norwegians."
 nor_without_germany_we_are_nothing: "没有德国，我们啥都不是"
 nor_without_germany_we_are_nothing_desc: "It's about time we loyal administrators of the Führer's will, acknowledge that Reichskommissariat Norwegen is nothing without the guiding hand of the Großgermanisches Reich. If there is any attempt to flee from Germania's administrative grip, it would surely end in utter failure for our united people. Our best bet at maintaining efficiency and guaranteeing a future is to remain firmly loyal to the Reich, which has never been stronger and more united! As the old saying goes: \"Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer\"..."
 nor_for_an_efficient_future: "为了高效的未来"
 nor_for_an_efficient_future_desc: "...dear God! With the Großgermanisches Reich having descended into Civil War our future is uncertain... Through thick and thin we've tried our best to maintain the Reichskommissariat over the past two decades. However, till now we always with the support of Germania, with our masters being no more who knows what the future holds for us. It's best we continue as before and hope to high heaven that our recent administrative changes will ensure the preservation of our current government. We must wish for an efficient and prosperous future..."
 NOR_free_at_last: "终究自由"
 NOR_free_at_last_desc: "We thought this day would never come -no, could not come- and yet by God's grace here we are. After a score years under the German boot, the Milorg has finally occupied Oslo, and the collaborators driven out. The Norwegian people are finally free!"
 NOR_purge_collabs: "清洗合作者"
 NOR_purge_collabs_desc: "The Huns have fled with their tails between their legs, and Norway is finally free from Nazi influence- or is it? Can it even be truly free when so many traitors of their people are still allowed to stand?\n\nAny and all Nazi collaborators still in our borders will be dug out and dealt with the way they earned themselves during those long two decades. And for the Nasjonal Samling -however much of it is even around after our purge, it shall never again be allowed to have a say in government."
 NOR_assume_control: "取得控制"
 NOR_assume_control_desc: "The collaborating administration has been properly dealt with- and as a result, our cabinet is almost entirely empty. Yet the nation is still in complete disarray, and the Okkupasjon left no party in a condition to effectively rule even over a stable Norway.\n\nWe didn't start our fight with the ambition to rule, and yet we are the only ones who can put an end to the chaos. The Milorg shall carry the burden of establishing a provisional government and assuming control of all necessary matters in Norway until order is restored once more."
 NOR_king_returns: "国王归来"
 NOR_king_returns_desc: "When the Okkupasjon begun, King Haakon VII staunchly refused to recognise the Quisling regime the Germans set up, and eventually was forced to flee to Great Britain and then Canada along with his family and several other nobles to escape persecution. But he never abdicated during his exile, and neither has his son, Olav V, upon his death; and even from abroad, they kept serving as a rallying point for the Resistance all these years.\n\nIt is time now for the Glücksburg family to return to its rightful place in Norway. Preparations are already underway for the arrival of Olav and his family, who has accepted our invitation back to the country, and for his true coronation in Oslo that a King of Norway deserves."
 NOR_rebuild_norway: "重建挪威"
 NOR_rebuild_norway_desc: "As the violent enthusiasm that came with independence reverts to the boring, sometimes bleak reality of life, the people start to show their wear and tear. The Norwegians have been through many hardships those two decades, and even freedom has yet to lift the weight of life for many. Now that we're no longer at the actual brink of ruin, our citizens at best have almost no motivation to keep working, at worst seek to be finally left alone to tend to their estate in peace.\n\nThis attitude is understandable, but the road to national recovery is still long, and we cannot afford to go on in this state. A massive propaganda campaign will take place within the next few day to reignite the people's vigor and remind them of their duty to help in the reconstruction of the country at this time of need- starting with the King himself addressing the people."
 NOR_abolish_nazi_codes: "撕毁纳粹法规"
 NOR_abolish_nazi_codes_desc: "With the nation we inherited from the Germans, we also inherited the bureaucratic mess they left behind: a complicated slew of organizations and legislation needed to handle the exploitation of Norwegen, many of them as nonsensical as they are cruel. It is time for all those codes to go the way of their creators and be phased out of our systems, so in their place we can restore old legislation where it still works, and replace it with brand new laws where it doesn't. As for the rare German organization which actually serves to modernize the nation and not oppress its people, it shall be given a new coat of paint, have the Nazi rhetoric peeled off, and be integrated into our own."
 NOR_free_speech: "给人民言论自由"
 NOR_free_speech_desc: "Now that the Nazi era legislation have been erased and replaced, the Germanization policy nationwide has been, needless to say, what we would call indefinitely postponed. Now we can officially restore the status of the Norwegian language as the official tongue of the nation.\n\nAdditionally, with the German censorship laws revoked, the time is right to legally reinstate unrestricted freedom of speech as part of our new constitution. For the first time in twenty years, the Norwegian folk will once again speak their mind."
 NOR_settler_question: "定居者问题"
 NOR_settler_question_desc: "Even as German rule has finally been overthrown in our lands, the effects of two decades of Nazi administration are quite more permanent: foremost of which being the numerous Germans who have settled in our lands during Nazi rule, some for many years now.\n\nDeciding what to do with those settlers has been... problematic to say the least. On one hand, most of the settlers didn't actually participate in Norwegian politics or in the atrocities committed, and many of them actually are behind fairly lucrative enterprises that could help us. On the other hand, these people still knew what was happening in Norwegen when they came here, and why the Germans wanted them here, and they were perfectly content with the implication. And as for the people- oh, the people seriously want them gone."
 NOR_back_to_germany: "赶回德国"
 NOR_back_to_germany_desc: "What even was the point of our valiant struggle sacrifice if, even after our moment of victory, we still let the Huns free to roam? Free to live on our land and to feed off our fields and to thrive off our labor? Free to boast that they were never truly defeated!\n\nInnocent as they may seem, the settlers knew what the Okkupasjon meant for us when they arrived to enrich themselves- and if they don't leave willingly- to their homeland, abroad, wherever else they damn well want to except here- they'll learn what the Reign of the Lion means for them now."
 NOR_repatriate_their_stuff: "没收财产"
 NOR_repatriate_their_stuff_desc: "The many many years of the German tainting our land and feasting off of our soil and toll are finally over as the settlers have been driven away from our homeland- and in their let's say abrupt leave, they have left behind them a sizable gift: all their personal properties, in assets, real estate and more, some arriving from Germany but most cultivated during their stay here.\n\nOf course, all this treasure is sitting on Norwegian soil, made of coveted Norwegian materials, built from Norwegian hands, and no one but Norwegians around to claim it as their own. Clearly, it is all Norwegian property, and it shall be acquired by the state as such. Let the suits in Germania protest all they want; we'll just consider this their long overdue rent."
 NOR_cautious_acceptance: "谨慎接受"
 NOR_cautious_acceptance_desc: "No matter how and why they arrived here, the German settlers came here as civilians looking to make a new life away from their past- away from Germania even- and at any rate most of them have truly stayed here long enough to consider this place their home. If we were to oust them from their new lives back into a land that might not even consider them their own anymore, how are we any better than the Germans?\n\nOf course, this does not mean that everyone will be allowed to live like they used to during German rule. The settlers must be integrated into our society post haste, and those who do not become upstanding Norwegian citizens just like they owe to will be sent back to their homeland anyway."
 NOR_tolerate_german: "容许德语"
 NOR_tolerate_german_desc: "One of the main roadblocks in the integration of the settlers proves to be the language barrier; the Quisling Regime had established German as the nation's official language, and indeed many of the settlers have never learnt a lick of Norwegian. Unfortunately, if we expect the integration process to go smoothly we will have to contend with this for a while, and tolerate the German language long imposed on us for at least a little while more as the German settlers learn to speak Norwegian on a sufficient level."
 NOR_matter_of_partisans: "游击队问题"
 NOR_matter_of_partisans_desc: "Dealing with the Germans was an easy choice, but sorting our schisms at home might not be. The support of the leftist partisans both within the Milorg itself and through the NKP's free army proved to be an immense and crucial help in missions during the Okkupasjon, as well as our final victory against the Germans; some even say victory could never come without them.\n\nAnd yet with our freedom secured, this help is now starting to prove regretful. The communists expect their voluntary sacrifices to be recognised and rewarded for, and now demand representation in the government-to-be. Many in the bureaucracy -as well as our own ranks- are repulsed by the idea of working with the socialists, and would gladly take any chance to nip the left wing in the bud. On the other hand, at this point it is unsure if we could actually contain the growing socialist influence even if we tried."
 NOR_work_with_left: "与左派合作"
 NOR_work_with_left_desc: "The NKP's influence in our politics and our peoples both is already too big to counteract at this point in time- and frankly, their contribution to the Resistance too great for us to deny without seeming hypocritical to everyone. Besides, the reds are a persistent lot; kick them out now and they will simply keep lurking about, organising their ranks underground and scheming their eventual takeover- just like they have been doing against the Germans for the last twenty years.\n\nOur only sensible choice right now is to work with the left best we can, not only so they will be appeased enough to let us do our work, but also to keep their activities in check, and attempt to steer them towards the immediate rebuilding of the nation more than our deposition. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer, the saying goes."
 NOR_national_unity: "强调民族团结"
 NOR_national_unity_desc: "Oh people of Norway, united against your former oppressors, will you now waste your freedom raising your arms against each other? Will you let your allegiance to your cause influence your decisions more than your companionship to your fellow man? Will you, oh people of Norway, let the Führer laugh from his office as he watches us tear each other to the ground harder than he ever could?\n\nEach of us has a different idea of what a new, rebuilt, great Norway must look like- vastly different at times- but in the end, this is what we're all here for- to rebuild Norway anew, to restore its former shine and glory. And this is what we must concentrate now- not to the petty details of tomorrow, but to the work that needs to be done here and now! And to this, let us all drink this evening, in the company of everyone who wants to see this nation strong."
 NOR_no_king_of_commies: "王匪不两立"
 NOR_no_king_of_commies_desc: "No King of Norway is going to bow down to the will of the communists! Did they really think we would break the shackles of the dictators past just to willingly tie ourselves to new ones? Haakon didn't realise the fault of his decision until the Germans came; whether he understands it or not, we must not let King Olav repeat the mistakes of his father.\n\nAnd in this day of glory, with the leftist threat growing in power by the day and -if only for a little more- our power to stop them at an apex, we shall strike while the iron is hot and free our young Norway, and our King, of their tainting touch. Alt for Norge!"
 NOR_fate_of_the_unions: "工会的命运？"
 NOR_fate_of_the_unions_desc: "Now that the communists themselves have been dealt with, we must take measures to make sure they shall not reemerge again; with this in mind, we'll need to take a lot at the nation's labor unions, a known breeding ground and rallying point for all kinds of leftists and radicals ever since the Industrial Revolution.\n\nOf course, the trade unions explicitly socialist in nature will have to be banned- that only makes sense. But there are some individuals in the Milorg that are not necessarily convinced that there's such a thing as a non-socialist union; in fact, they believe, all unions harbor socialists inside them, and the only way to keep them under control will be to have the state control all of them. A contentious matter, really- and one that needs to be debated soon."
 NOR_disband_provisional_government: "任务结束"
 NOR_disband_provisional_government_desc: "It has been many arduous months since we took the reins on a nation young and broken, but we have finally accomplished all we set out to do. The collaborationists have paid for their treason, the policies and institutions still clinging from the days of the Nazis have been erased and replaced with our own, and order has been restored throughout the nation. The transitional period is over, and Norway is finally ready again to function and develop as a modern, functioning nation.\n\nThis in turn means that our job here is done, and our services will no longer be needed. The Milorg must step down and the provisional government it controls disband, so that free elections can take place and a democratically-elected civilian government can take charge from now on."
 NOR_elections: "举行选举"
 NOR_elections_desc: "It was back in 1936 that the Norwegian people last had a say on how they should be governed; ever since then, it was considered gift enough that they were still around to be governed at all. Stick around they did, though, to see the day that the Hun no longer loomed over their heads.\n\nThis day shall stay in history as the day we returned the people their self-determination. The first elections after the Okkupasjon will be organised nationwide shortly, after the until recently defunct political parties get a chance to stretch their limbs and run their campaigns. And once the ballots close, Norway will finally be truly free."
 NOR_no_more_neutrality: "不再中立"

We cannot afford to let such grievances tear us apart.\n\nIn fact, reaching out to our Swedish brethren might be even more beneficial to us exactly because of their position in the Pakt: mostly free to determine their policies, yet with an eye on German politics and knowledge of their tactics, Sweden could provide us with some wonderful insight on how to counteract the Reich when they strike.

The window exploding towards him, burying him and the passengers in a wall of water and glass, the pressure on his chest as water flushed out of him, the worried face of the Eastern Front veteran who had saved him, the sharp bite of the sun as he looked around in confusion, the limp bodies bystanders had covered with jackets. Then, the angry gazes of the two trenchcoated Gestapo officers, the hand reaching into the coat for something, only for the other officer to stop him with a pat on the arm as the crowds closed in around the \"accident\"...\n\nThe dead man chortled a mirthless laughter as he gazed around the room.

Like a cluster of wasps, they have danced around us and evaded our swipes, swooping in to sting us over and over when we least expected. Once an unorganised cluster of individuals, Milorg now boasts a large network of dedicated soldiers, each and every one fuelled with a burning hatred for the German and a determination to drag their nation back into democratic degeneracy. Since 1941, this organization has disrupted our supply lines, sabotaged our intelligence and raided our stockpiles. Enemies of the state have been set free from prison and given either a free pass into Sweden or a weapon to continue the fight. Good men, both German and Norwegian, have been murdered in cold blood - with no regard spared for any innocents killed along the way.\n\nMilorg is a monstrous organization that cares little for the consequences of collateral damage. Many civilian Norwegians have been gunned down and blown up by these creatures, and yet Milorg continues to inspire the support of the masses due to their immense propaganda efforts.

Criminal and militant elements are nothing new in the Reichskommissariat, but our methods of dealing with them have become more tenuous as of late. The reasoning for this is complex, but one of the most significant contributing factors is the status of our border with Sweden. Intelligence and Police forces have confirmed that the Milorg are receiving aid, financial and material, from across the border and show no signs of stopping. Inquiries to the Swedes return only denials of any malfeasance occurring; their feigned ignorance only solidifies our suspicions that the Swedish government itself could be assisting terrorist elements within the Reichskommissariat.\n\nIt is clear action must be taken, but we are presented with few options. We can increase police presence at border checkpoints and double inspections to attempt to catch contraband, but this will likely only have returns on the checkpoints and border stations themselves. We could crack down even harder and deploy garrison elements at key positions along the entire border to ensure the Milorg has no avenue of entry or exit; such a move may make the Swedes anxious, however, and impact our relationship."

When pressed these individuals apologize, claiming that they have no time to study or that it was merely a force of habit, but go right back to substituting their foreign tongue the very next day.

While the orders are being put into effect where they can - much to the relief of the garrison and administration - worry can be felt among the native populace. Conversations in German are tinged with anxiety as native Norwegians who struggle to remember words for certain concepts or situations fear to get caught asking for clarification in Norwegian by an overzealous neighbor or police officer.\n\nAdditionally, several members of the Reichskommissariat's administration have expressed sympathy for those who are genuinely unable to speak German, and believe that the Department of Cultural Affairs has taken an inefficient method of hastening Germanization. A proposal has been brought forth to the Reichskommissar in hopes of coaxing a solution forth.\n\nThe orders can remain in law yet unenforced so as to please most parties, but will slow this area of Germanization.

Still, while Scandinavia will never rival the fertile plains of Reichskommissariat Ukraine for sheer output, it is sufficient to feed our population and keep the majority of Norwegians employed.\n\nOur economy has not been stagnant however, and as of late has in fact shown the first transformations into a diversifying market. Due to the needs of the Reichskommissariat as well as the evolution of Norway into a more modern nation has resulted in increased demand for industrial potential and goods. Our cities have continued to grow in part to the increasing rise in industrial jobs and careers available, and a respectable shipbuilding industry has now solidified.\n\nRegardless, the fact remains that Norway exports its value to the Reich and Europe, and efforts should be taken to increase the production and growth of the Scandinavian Peninsula where possible."

The sun shone as dozens of citizens stood beside the road and waved at the car and its escorts...\n\n\"I don't fault you for thinking so.\" The reply came out much colder than the Reichskommissar intended. Looking from his backseat window he smiled out towards the pedestrians, but his mind was occupied with a much more serious issue. The Milorg, the Norwegian resistance against the Reich's rule, had long been on the fringes of his worries but as of late have grown bolder. Their ties strengthened, there've been reports that they are operating in the cities again in greater force; if they are not rooted out it will be only a matter of time before they try something truly brazen. Eyes passing over the citizens once more, he mused and wondered how many listen to the resistance with open ears, how many lend them shelter, who among them are in fact members themselves.\n\nShifting, the Reichskommissar turned back towards the chauffeur. Surveillance efforts have been lax of late, they'd need to be rectified to ensure the security of the nation. The degree of investigation, however, bears consideration. A small increase in state surveillance is necessary and won't be felt too considerably, but a dedicated task force to monitor the citizens and large increases in reporting and analysis would surely root out more dissidents."

 norway.9.desc: "There's been a change in the wind, and all in Norway can feel which way it's blowing; it was gradual at first, but ever so slightly it has built force and speed, and now threatens to sweep up the entire German experiment with it.\n\nWhere before Norwegians could be seen giving a crisp German salute to members of the administration or the garrison, now you are lucky to see even a curt nod. The youth vandalize and tarnish storefronts of the most loyal collaborators, and few in the community try to bring them to account. Worst of all, public opposition and vocal protests have been developing in earnest for the first time since the worst years of the Reichskommissariat.\n\nNaturally investigations - and a few interrogations - quickly made clear the source of this growing discontent for all to see; the Milorg infiltrated urban areas and communities and disseminated their viral propaganda in the form of conversation, physical flyers, and even song. Further afield in the more rural areas, garrisons only have limited control of their regions and a concerning number of physical confrontations are being reported.\n\nThe average citizen is starting to reconsider who they think their true savior is."

In response, the Reichskommissar has authorised all available state capacity to investigate, locate, and neutralize unsanctioned civilian propaganda. To this end, the Reichskommissariat garrison, state security agencies, and local and federal police forces have been organized and dispatched to secure the cultural safety of the citizens of Reichskommissariat Norwegen. Domestic subversive group designated 'Milorg' is identified as the propagator of the aforementioned cultural sabotage, and has been further labelled as our highest priority for apprehension and neutralization.\n\nAdditionally, urban centers will receive higher concentrations of public monitoring and citizen investigation. A curfew is being considered, but in the interim citizens will be required to record their activities for presentation to a security investigator upon request. Further, movement across the Reichskommissariat will only be authorized for vehicles including, but not limited to, registered state vehicles, garrison vehicles, military vehicles, supply and transportation vehicles, vehicles containing a certified state agent of Reichskommissariat Norwegen, vehicles containing a certified state agent of the Großgermanisches Reich, and 'undercover' collection vehicles (see attached file 1A for details)."

The unending tide of years has changed the face of Norway, however, and many of our needs and desires have long since evolved from those of our farm-steading ancestors.\n\nOur cities are growing at a pace not seen before in our history, and with them come the fuel they need to continue; planes, trains, radio sets, and even televisions all have become expected sights of the urban citizenry as opposed to curious luxuries. Unfortunately the nation as yet lacks the industries required to build our own, and as such we end up paying large sums of money for imports from across the Einheitspakt.\n\nPerhaps a tipping point has been reached, however, regarding the Norwegian economy. We possess a large and dedicated workforce throughout the nation, but they are currently relegated to the fields and livestock in agriculture. Norwegian farming, while competitive with the continent, cannot match it in output, and has in a sense given us the opportunity to respecialize our economy. We could shift our focus on growing a functional and healthy section of light and heavy industry to compete with Germany and drive down costs of consumer goods, or we can deepen our agricultural supremacy and focus on exporting the natural goods we already produce to Pakt nations for profit. Both will continue to grow as our economy grows regardless, but embracing one will give it the foundation it needs for Norway to become a cornerstone of the European market."

However, as both Europe stabilizes under the Reich and the Einheitspakt generates increased economic cooperation, it would seem that our northern Reichskommissariat is beginning to make the full transition to an industrial member of our Hegemony. Applications for permits to develop heavy industries like aircraft engines, large-scale ship construction, chemical plants, and even a television factory have been issued to the industrial offices of Norway.\n\nWhile the smaller banks and investment groups eye the growing market with interest, the heads of Germany's largest corporations such as Siemens and IG Farben are already making large financial moves to capitalize on the decision. Only time will tell how this development shall shape the Reich itself in the coming future, but it would seem that the younger Norwegian population is quite keen on the news as they hope to escape into a much more lucrative job market than would have existed otherwise."

While such output mostly serves to meet the population's needs and pales in comparison to other heavy farming regions such as the Ukranian breadbasket, Norway's continual investment has managed to curb incidences of famine as well as bolster a respectable export market.\n\nCalling this development 'news' is perhaps a step too far, as for the vast majority of Norway's citizens - as well as the people of the Einheitspakt itself - there will not be a noticeable difference in their lives. Work will continue apace and there will be further gradual advancements in yield and fertility, and all the while the people of Scandinavia will not have to fear going to sleep on an empty stomach. Outside the benefits of food, this will solidify our trade network with them and further make Norway dependent on German exports and capital; a fine foundation for the Reich's future growth."

The death of Hitler has upended any hope of our ship of state continuing its course unimpeded, and in truth none can say what the future of Norway holds.\n\nThe Reich tears itself apart at the seams and the gutters of Germany are already choked with blood, and this is still only the beginning. Calls and messages come in from those aligned with the successors hourly, ordering, threatening, and pleading for our support, though in truth we have no safe harbor to turn to. We lie adrift in the storm with nought but our efforts to show for it; we must hope that our work in recent months will keep us afloat.\n\nOur actions in codifying our national language, tackling extant propaganda, and monitoring the border should work to reduce any subversive acts in this turbulent era; the last thing we desire are those who seek more upheaval in this time. Further, our implementation of recent investments into our transportation network and wider economy will hopefully manage to keep us in one piece during this period, though for how long none can say. We must hope the bloodbath on the continent resolves itself quickly, for without Germany there stands no power we can safely and readily anchor ourselves to.\n\nUltimately, the results of our reforms may be critical to Norway's future, even if we cannot see what that may be. For now there is little to do but to wait, watch, and learn firsthand how quickly so-called brothers will fall upon each other like wolves. We pray that whatever emerges from this crucible is no more horrific than what made it in the first place."

The German brutes have long oppressed the peaceful and democratic populace, shooting any dissenters and raping its agriculture for the good of the Reich. The dissolution of Terboven's administration heralded little change, as the fascist pigs in the Nasjonal Samling regime squabbled over the power vacuum. What the citizens of Norway did not expect, however, was such a drastic change in leadership.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, the resistance organization Milorg gathered as many men, women and supplies as they could muster, and overran the city of Oslo. In the bloody coup that followed the collaborationist scum were ousted from power, and the parliamentary NS traitors have been duly arrested. The organizer of the revolution and leader of Milorg, the grizzled rebel Knut Møyen, has declared the formation of a new provisional government. While Møyen's leadership will temporarily enforce authoritarian measures, it is with the goal of transforming Norway once more into a functioning democracy."

His close ties to Terboven's administration and loyalty to the Reich has propelled him to becoming the figurehead of the party's Radical faction.

It stared back mockingly.\n\nSmoke streamed out of Olsen's nose. How much of this evidence had been deliberately left behind was yet to be discovered. It wouldn't be the first time these terrorists had planted misleading traps in their abandoned hideouts.\n\nSomething caught his eye. Olsen glanced down at the scrap of paper caught under his boot. A leaflet. He bent down and plucked it up, drawing it close to his bloodshot eyes. Two words were imposed upon a black and white picture of Norwegians celebrating in the streets: 'MAI 17'. Olsen sighed heavily. The national day of celebration. The picture had to be from 1939, before the Germans banned that tradition.

Since the outbreak of the horrific civil war in Germany, he had been plagued with bouts of panic attacks and unending nightmares. To think that Aryan brothers were slaughtering each other on the altar of their leader's hubris made him sick to the stomach. The Thousand Year Reich, collapsing into bloodshed and destruction after just thirty years.\n\nThe Reichskommissar placed his glasses back on and frowned in deep thought. His entire garrison was sitting aimlessly in the Norwegian snow like children stranded from their parents. Norway had seen two decades of Germanization, and Nasjonal Samling was desperate to fully seize power and establish their nation as an independent but loyal member of the Pakt. Why deny them this opportunity? Was this not the perfect moment to herald such a drastic change?\n\nTerboven lifted a pen and started to write. He had to take matters into his own hands.

One of the prime countries of Scandinavia, with beautiful northern nights adorning the frigid cold, as years upon years of hatred had been dealt upon the land, savaged by the German Reich. Now, for the first time in years, the people of Norway, prideful of their past, their present, and now, their future, have the opportunity to decide how they shall govern themselves in the midst of their newly established democracy. Nationalism has surged in the north as finally, the people have gotten their wishes: a Norway for the Norwegians.\n\nHowever, all is not calm and peaceful for the Norwegian people. Rather, the Milorg-led government has had to exhaust all resources on organizing the preparedness for a transparent election. The Norwegians are, in fact, lucky, as they've managed to garner several broad choices for who ought to lead their new democracy: Firstly, Alv Kjøs leading the Høyre, who's been supported by most of the conservative elements of the Milorg for his plan to \"return to tradition\" and favor a strengthening of the Norwegian people in their newfound independence. Next, Gunnar Garbo has led the Venstre into great pockets of both middle-class and upper-class support for his desire to hold economic programs as being the primary focus for getting Norway back on track on the international level. Einar Gerhardsen has led the mainstream leftist elements in forming the Arbeiterpartiet, leading a movement to centralize government efforts and aim low, towards upholding the people's needs as the primary issue for Norway going forward.\n\nHowever, past the mainstream tickets vying for leadership within the crags and mountaintops of Norway, the Milorg has found surprising openness for the parties, in the allowance of the Socialists within the Sosialistisk Folkeparti, or the SFP, led by Knut Løfsnes, a direct target for some extremists within the Milorg. There, Løfsnes has thumped the reports and argued, with fire and scorn, over the need for a decentralization of the Norwegian government, with its primary focus only for the direct aid of the citizens within, rather than focusing on other matters such as military or trade.\n\nAfter months of preparation, the candidates have prepared their claims. The posters have been handed out, the speeches have been held, and the debates argued out. Without a countryman unaware of the political battle, Norway's fate is in the hands of her people..."

Now, more than ever, the freedom of choice has been granted to the citizens within the government; however, with effective actions from the right-most factions within the Milorg, the SFP and several other radical leftist movements have been excluded for participation within the elections.\n\nHowever, the time has come, and Norway will bear a new face, whether the Milorg likes it or not. To fill the spots of those potentially left behind from Nazi persecution as well as exclusion on behalf of the Milorg, several other candidates have seized the opportunity to lead. Firstly, Alv Kjøs has grown to lead the conservative elements within Norway, to form the Høyre, with a desire to stay true to Norwegian culture's roots while maintaining a strong element on the world stage to bolster the new government, seeking to maintain Norwegian autonomy while emboldening the government to step forward in progress. Next, Gunnar Garbo leads a more central faction within the Norwegian political sphere, as those Norwegians who stand inspired by the greater democracies of the world stand with Garbo and the Venstre. The Venstre seek to expand both upwards and outwards in their attempts to generate growth within the newfound government, and aid Norwegians in being able to claim their power on the world stage via strategic economics and trade. Finally, Einar Gerhardsen has been treading the line against the right-leaning factions of the Milorg to carefully answer the call of the liberal populaces within Norway by creating the Arbeiterpartiet. Within the party, Norwegians call for the centralization of the federal power within the government in order to provide for each and every citizen who may call for needs and wants, to serve the Norwegians which have made the country so great.\n\nTo say that the stability of the recent government has been completely cemented would be an overestimate. Milorg's crackdown on the more extremist elements within the nation have left some feeling scorned; nevertheless, backtracking would slow the path for Norway.

However, one that also served to take away the freedoms of the youth within the free country. One of the most controversial issues of the twentieth century: the Draft.\n\nOn one side, conservative hardliners maintain their wall of support for the drafting program to be upheld, and continuously dig in their heels further to keep the policy intact. Membership within the coalition formulate that the maintenance of a powerful military ensures a guarantee on the freedoms of all Norwegians, and that any threat from the outside world would be equally met by those who sacrifice time and work in the name of national peace, prosperity, and justice. Battle-hardened veterans, fundamentalists of Norwegian culture, strict political militarists within the Storting: all those who had been beaten, bruised, and broken by the Nazi's heel due to the lack of a superior military force to stand up against their oppresors.\n\nOn the other hand, however, the rising representatives of the growing progressive movement within Norway. There, a variety of representatives have come together to stand as defiers to the conservative wall. Rather than continue the forced conscription of the youth into the Norwegian military, the coalition seeks to undo the drafting process for the sake of Norway's economic, political, and societal unity and prosperity. Rather than live in a continuous state of fear, the progressives, made up of economic cliques, student-organizers turned leaders, and labor representatives of the nation seek to move on from the terror that was the Nazi occupation and truly create a positive democracy, one which will allow for the Norwegian people to live as they like.\n\nAs the politicians rage on, the nation has come to a standstill in the schools, businesses, and even city centers. Some within the youth hide in fear of having to go towards a path they were never prepared for; on the other hand, some seek to do their forefathers proud and maintain the shield they built in the military.

The Second World War proved this, as the question of \"who was a true soldier of their country\" blurred the lines as men and women took up arms against those dreaded invaders, as the male dominance of the military dominated the past, while women continuously proved competent in battle. Now, the question is raised once more in Oslo.\n\nAs the battle lines continue to be drawn, some Norwegians have continuously argued that while the military must be opened further, women \"deserve the pride to serve alongside their fellow countrymen; but, not on the battlefield, the country needs them too much for that,\" as one key representative of the coalition argues. To this end, however, the coalition remains unstable, as despite the great levels of support from some older, more conservative blocs of representation, infighting over the possibility of combat roles or not have torn the group apart from one another. This level of infighting and controversy has ignited rounds of dissatisfaction from within the Storting.\n\nHowever, the opposition has stood resolute against the difficulties of the fundamentalist forces within the legislation. In this, the small coalition representing a variety of women's groups have argued for the full allowance of women into all recognized military positions, including combat positions. Despite the small group of support, the fiery rhetoric and calling upon the female members of the fiery Norwegian resistance leading to the Milorg have allowed for the group within the legislature to continuously grow with a powerful cause backing them.\n\nThus, as Norway once was, the government within the country has become a battle waging over control of the country's direction. Traditionalists and progressives battle in the halls of the government, reminding Norwegians across the country of the battles they had fought to get here, and who to honor for such valiance."

 norway.38.desc: "Major Akselsen, despite the long, medal-adorned, dark green coat he had adorned, still felt the icy breeze of the Norwegian forests pass down his spine as he looked onwards to the soldiers below. For so long, both had fought so hard, battles which the Major frequently recalled as a rising star within the Milorg during its early days, leading ambushes against motorized Nazi convoys passing along the Norwegian-Swedish border during his early days. Sure, although those memories may have earned Akselsen the medals on his coat, they also earned him the scars on his face and the blood on his hands. Yet, at the same time, he knew such memories protected the two countries from the dangers of tyranny so long as the two had citizens left to fight for it; however, the memories did not protect Akselsen from the bootsteps of a superior coming next to him.\n\nAn impressive array of military ribbons donned upon a tall, intimidating figure first caught Akselson's attention, before he realized just who was approaching: a legend, no, the legend, Generalmajor Stig Synnergren. The man who had protected Swedish independence past the exploitation of Scandinavia at the hands of the Wehrmacht, he provoked Akselson to muster the greatest salute he could for the Generalmajor. \"At ease, Major Akselson.\" the General said, before offering Akselson a handshake. Akselson clamored for a response, saying \"Well, you ought to be proud, Major, with the high command has been talking about you, you helped pave the path for all of this, after all.\" Synnergren interrupted. Akselson didn't know how to respond, the high command talking about him? What in the name of God for? \"With all due respect, sir, I'm sure there isn't much need for all of tha-\" \"Major.\" Synnergren interrupted, sternly this time. Akselson felt as if he had made a mistake, as if he had made a grave mistake in front of one of the highest ranked men in Scandinavia. \"Akselson, whether you like it or not, you're a hero to Norway and beyond. You may not have gone out in the forests with a handful of men and a submachine gun in your hands to become known as a hero, but that is what you've done. You're a soldier, Akselson, a soldier, an officer, and a symbol for people across the world, all of those who remain in chains because of those bastards in the Reich. Be proud.\"\n\nThe Generalmajor turned with the Major to look onwards as various infantry regiments and tank divisions marched off to the forest for training."
 norway.38.a: "\"Thank you, sir.\""
 norway.39.t: "As Nordics, We Stand Together."
 norway.39.desc: "The constant talk of management and organization of Operation Fortwall had bored the Swedish Generalmajor as he walked forwards, with the sight of veteran Norwegian and Swedish infantry units marching out into the forests, and the babbling of subordinates giving organizational reports behind him. It may have been his assignment to carry out for the next few weeks of joint military exercises, but a man could not deny the clawings of boredom as they grew, could he? That was, until Generalmajor Synnergren was stopped in his tracks at the appearance of an unsuspecting officer: a shining youth of the Norwegian Army, bearing as many medals above his breast pocket as there were scars upon his face, with a name that ran true legend through the words of the General Staff of both nations: Major Tor Akselson, a hero of the Norwegian resistance. The Generalmajor had to regain his composure as he approached the quickly rising young soldier.\n\nHis quiet bootsteps forward had not delayed the Major's quick, even rushed salute. Though honored, Synnergren felt more honor in being able to meet the rising pupil within the Norwegian ranks, and now, a comrade in arms. \"At ease, Major Akselson.\" The Generalmajor said sternly, despite offering a handshake for the Major. With Synnergren noticing the Major seemed nervous, like a child getting caught by a parent, the Generalmajor said \"Well, you ought to be proud, Major, with the high command has been talking about you, you helped pave the path for all of this, after all.\" \"With all due respect, sir, I'm sure there isn't much need for all of tha-\"\n\nGoddamnit. This kid's a hero, not some washed up recruit hotshot, the Generalmajor thought. \"Major.\" Synnergren finally said, stopping the man in his tracks. \"Akselson, whether you like it or not, you're a hero to Norway and beyond. You may not have gone out in the forests with a handful of men and a submachine gun in your hands to become known as a hero, but that is what you've done. You're a soldier, Akselson, a soldier, an officer, and a symbol for people across the world, all of those who remain in chains because of those bastards in the Reich. Be proud.\"\n\nSynnergren had only hoped that he had prepared a good enough speech for the man to gain some confidence in himself, as he saw that the bright man, rising swiftly through the ranks as he had been, stared forward, contemplatively. \"Thank you, sir. I, well, very much appreciate it, sir.\" Major Akselson said."

 norway.40.t: "The Coronation"
 norway.40.desc: "For the first time since 1954, Olav was truly scared. He placed a firm hand on his trembling right leg and took a deep breath, turning his gaze to the window. Glimpses of daily life flashed past like images on a film reel. He saw a mother with her child. A woman walking her dog. A citizen marching down the street with a stiff gait and a high chin. A military man.\n\nOlav smiled. He himself had served as a general in the Second World War. So desperately had he wanted to remain with his fellow Norwegians as the Nazis pushed onwards, but his father would not have it. He would be more useful in exile, he was told, but what use was a fleeing man? What use was he when the Germans stormed England? As snowy Canada drew nearer, so did the fire within him rage harder.\n\nThe horror of the 1940s felt like another lifetime. As much as he had loathed his exile, nothing in the world would make him regret the safety and comfort it brought his family. Olav's father had lost the spark in his eyes, but his children had gained theirs. Through it all was Märtha. Beloved Märtha. A soft touch in days of weakness, a soothing voice in nights of anger and tears. Not once did she lose her smile, even as the cancer slowly stole her away. His father had died just three years later. Never again were they to feel Norwegian snow upon their faces.\n\nThe People's King, they called him. Apparently. What did Olav's speeches and meetings really mean, in the safety of his Canadian residence? The common people sacrificed their lives, their families, their spirits for Norway... and yet he was the symbol of resistance? The images outside the window had changed. Crowds of people were screaming in the streets, holding signs and chanting. The car came to a stop. The door opened. Olav took a deep breath and exited.\n\nCheering. It hit him like a crushing wave, nearly knocking the strength from his legs. He floated towards Nidaros Cathedral, and the cameras watched eagerly as he seated himself on the throne. The coronation felt like a dream. A heavy crown was placed upon his head, and with it came the weight of the whole nation. He knew his words were to be broadcast in every household throughout the country.\n\n\"I am home,\" King Olav said with a steely gaze, even as his eyes watered. \"I am home, and the people of Norway will never suffer again. I promise.\""

Jakob glanced down at the small badge resting on his open palm, his thumb tracing the circular symbol. It was everything, and nothing. A symbol of hope, and an old metal pin.\n\nHe looked back to his two compatriots. They pushed and pulled their oars silently, the dark of night enveloping their Waffen-SS uniforms. He owed Arne and Thor his life, and they trusted him with theirs. The operation was likely a trap, but it hadn't stopped the trio from setting out to sea in the dead of night. The anonymous tip had been suspiciously specific, detailing the exact hour of the exact night that the men guarding the southern sector of Gimle would be mysteriously absent from their posts. Milorg had received many mysterious reports, some even truthful, but few as detailed or precise as this one."

The three men slouched low and scurried forwards through the trees, straining to hear anything aside from their increasingly heavy breathing. Norwegian voices drifted towards them from the west, and even distantly from the east. The Førergarde. For the first, and probably only time in his life, Jakob thanked God that he was wearing an SS uniform. Even if they were spotted in the shadows, they could simply claim to be new Waffen recruits.\n\nThe Villa Grande, the corpse-white building at the center of the property, lit the night between the trees with its glowing windows. He led Thor and Arne around the Stone Garden and towards its secret passageway, exactly as the map had detailed. Slicing through the ground was a narrow concrete entrance ending at a small door. It was unprotected. Jakob instinctively looked around him. No approaching footsteps. No chatter. No rustling. Just silence. The trio crept forwards. Jakob pushed the door carefully, the deafening thud of his heart reverberating in his ears. It swung open without resistance. He turned to his two friends with a crooked smile.\n\nThey were in."

His mind drifted once more to the anonymous tip, which had contained the layout of the Villa Grande. He and his compatriots had memorised it intently. They continued on past the pantry, turning left to sneak through the storage room and the servant cellar, before arriving at the servant stairway leading directly to the top. Up and up they went, their boots gently pressing against every step. At last they reached the top floor, where a long stretch of corridor awaited them. If his memory served correctly these were the servants' bedrooms. He inched forwards, barely breathing. The trio were uniformed, yes, but would that be enough? Time seemed to slow down as he reached the end of the corridor and pushed open the door, releasing a shaky breath.\n\nJakob surveyed the kitchen - and instantly locked eyes with a small blond man. His breathing stopped. The man froze, eyes wide in surprise, hands motionless inside his large ball of dough. Thor and Arne suddenly pushed past Jakob and strode towards the exit on the far side of the kitchen, their chests puffed up in feigned arrogance. Jakob followed their lead, glaring at the cook with intensity. A look of dread spread across the man's deathly pale face and he averted his gaze, continuing to knead. Jakob felt a pang of sickness in the pit of his stomach as he left the kitchen and made his way past the central spiral staircase leading to the floor below."

Works of fiction had caught his attention lately, and he had found himself drifting away from journals of great Norwegian polar adventurers and delving into tales of fancy. Even as he scanned the sentences before him, he felt his mind wandering to the past.\n\nThe winds of fate had swept up many men throughout the twentieth century, lifting them to greatness unforetold. Not Vidkun Quisling. He had been tossed aside like a puppet without strings, destined to lay motionless in his mansion for the rest of days. Oh, how certain he had been of his future. He remembered the chilly winds whipping at his face as he distributed food aid for the famished peasants of Russia; with the evils of Bolshevism bared before him, he swore to protect his nation from the same fate... only to open the gates to the German thugs, who taunted him with promises of power while stomping on the face of Norway.\n\nParanoia had gripped him for many years. Resistance movements, schemers within Nasjonal Samling, the Germans themselves - every day he feared the cold embrace of death would seize him or his wife, Maria. Over time, the grizzled old loyalists in the Førergarde were being replaced by those dead-eyed Waffen-SS youngsters 'gifted' by the administration. The Førergarde were stationed to keep dangers out of the Villa Grande; the Waffen-SS, he suspected, were there to keep Quisling in."

Jakob's throat was so dry he could barely swallow.\n\nThe trio moved onwards at a quicker pace, striding past the white walls of the Great Dining Hall. The Villa Grande was just as grandiose on the inside as it had been on the outside. Jakob remembered a phrase his mother had once told him and smiled. 'It is the most beautiful places that house the ugliest beasts'. At the end of the Hall, the library door awaited them, bright light streaming out from underneath. Just a wooden door stood between them and their target.\n\nHe gave a reassuring nod to his friends. Arne replied with a grimace and a stiff thumbs up, while Thor grunted in acknowledgment and wiped more sweat from his forehead. Jakob pulled out the badge and kissed it gently."

He stormed towards the three men. \"No one is to enter my private library!\" He could feel the sudden hot tears welling up in his eyes. \"Do I not even have this?!\"\n\nThe guard in front silently pulled out a badge and handed it to Quisling. He glanced at it in bleary-eyed confusion. It displayed a large 'O' containing a smaller 'V', adorned with a crown... His blood turned to ice. He looked up in shock to see a silenced pistol aimed straight at him.\n\n\"Oh,\" Quisling muttered. The muzzle flashed a blinding light and delivered him into darkness."

Pinned to his bathrobe was a badge of royal authority, a symbol and calling card of the brutal Milorg terrorists. How the murderers were able to infiltrate his high security residence is, as of yet, unknown.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the grieving parliamentarians, Per Borten praised Quisling's strong presence in Norwegian politics: \"The brutal murder of Vidkun Quisling, a figure of stability throughout the last two decades, provides a chilling reminder that the nation must embrace unity over division. Only by rejecting such senseless violence can we work on healing our scars, and creating a better Norway.\"\n\nEarlier today the general-secretary of Nasjonal Samling, Gulbrand Lunde, reminisced about the past in a radio address: \"I recall the early days of our Party, and the powerful national spirit that emanated from its Fører. His love of the Norwegian people and bravery in the face of the growing threat of Bolshevism in the east was an inspiration to us all.\"\n\nChief of Police and Minister of Security, Jonas Lie, delivered a brief statement in which he swore to bring these butchers to justice: \"All of our resources will be put into investigating Quisling's death. I promise to the Norwegian people that the murderers will be caught, prosecuted, and hanged for their crimes.\"\n\nThe 76 year old Vidkun Quisling leaves behind a widow, Maria Quisling.

 POLITICS_KNUT_MOYEN_DESC: "Knut Møyen has held a dream for many years now- the liberation of his home nation, Norway. His dream has been achieved. He never really held the aspiration of leading this new Norway- in his own words, he's only a businessman- but it seems that the situation has called for him to take the mantle as well. Now, Knut Møyen has the unenviable task of preparing Norway for its transition to a true democracy, and in the eyes of his many supporters, there's nobody better for the job.\n\nBorn in 1907, Knut was only an athlete and a businessman before the Germans came and tore down everything he loved. In such a terrible situation, Knut did what every brave son of Norway did and joined the resistance, choosing the Milorg in particular. Within a year, Møyen rose through the ranks of the resistance, becoming the head of Milorg. Under his rule, Milorg's activities crippled and hindered German movements across all of Norway, turning much of the nation into a no-go zone for the Heer and swelling Milorg's numbers to 20,000 strong in his tenure as its head.\n\nUnfortunately, Møyen would be forced to escape to Sweden by a Gestapo raid, leaving for London soon afterwards. When England fell to the German invaders, he fled to Scotland. Finally, he made his perilous return to his home, retaking the reigns of command from his subordinates. It is of the opinion of most Norwegians that Møyen's leadership is the main reason as to how the Milorg remained active in the decades since the war ended. However, even with his leadership, it was the opinion of many that Milorg, and the resistance in general, was reaching its last legs by the early 60's, with slowly shrinking numbers and an increasingly apathetic population.\n\nThat is, until Germany collapsed in on itself in a spectacular implosion, and Terboven and his men left for home. In the chaos that followed, Møyen and Milorg swept into Oslo, throwing out the weak collaborators that remained and proclaiming a new Norway, free of German influence. Now, Møyen's focus switches to reversing the laws and regulations the Germans dared to impose on Norway, reinstituting the Kingdom, and returning the nation to what it was before the war. Once this is finished, Møyen will take his leave, having left his mark as a hero to all Norway."

 POLITICS_GULBRAND_LUNDE_DESC: "当特博文和他的手下放弃挪威，回到他们分崩离析的祖国时，挪威的文官政府也随之瓦解。改革派、强硬派和温和派从国民联盟的尸体中分裂出来。冲突在奥斯陆蔓延，混乱和猜疑席卷挪威。最后，秩序占了上风，主流维持了控制并稳定了挪威。他们的顶头还有谁？那是国民联盟最长久的终身会员——居尔布兰·伦德。\n\n伦德从前是一个专攻生物化学的化学家。但对维德孔·吉斯林和他的党，即国民联盟的支持，让他暂时搁置了他的科学追求。作为其最早的成员之一，伦德作为一个管理者可谓能力出众，忠诚且勤奋。当国民联盟最终掌权时，伦德的忠心也让他被提拔成为了部长，加入了挪威政坛。在此期间，尽管伦德经常因为他的民族主义观点而触怒德国驻军，比如他试图把挪威人从日耳曼人种中区分出来。事实上，人们普遍认为德国人不让伦德担任文官政府高层职位的原因就在于他的种族观点。但现在没有德国人在侧阻止，伦德也就顺理成章地获得了他努力争夺的权力。\n\n伦德的政策并不强调为挪威带来太多改变。尽管他有数个政策预案，诸如结束日耳曼化，他并不介意以合作国的身份重新加入团结协定。对于大部分挪威人来说，特博文就像没有离开过一样。"
 POLITICS_JONAS_LIE_DESC: "当问及任何一个挪威的男男女女，乃至孩童对约纳斯·李的看法时，询问者总会得到各种令人啼笑皆非的回答。对于激进合作者来说，李是一个英雄，是唯一一个为他们的利益而工作的人。对于温和派来说，李很危险。他是希姆莱的朋友，他想以私生子版本的德意志概念取代挪威的概念。对于抵抗组织来说，李是一个恶心的猪猡，他躬身去舔德国人踩在挪威背脊上的鞋底。但有一个关于他的事实无可置疑——挪威现在处于他的铁腕之下。\n\n作为名作家老约纳斯·李的儿子，小约纳斯·李曾是挪威警界的高层，也是一位杰出的作家。他的写作经验让他撰写了大量的政治论文。他一被德国人俘获，其观点就迅速转向了亲德立场，他也得以正确地押注德国能赢得战争。自那时起，约纳斯不仅在德军中服役，他还组建了挪威党卫军，并成为了国民联盟的高阶成员。当大战结束，李以一个狂热亲德政治家的身份回到了挪威并就任警察部长一职。从那时起，他开始等待时机来按照自己的意愿重塑挪威。当特博文离开后，李抓住了机会并战胜了对手，从而夺取了挪威的控制权。\n\n现在李控制了挪威，而整个国家都在其下颤抖。事实上，李认为德国人并不是离开了，他们只是暂时水土不服。因此他也一心要维护好当下的一切事物，包括日耳曼化政策，以待德国人无可避免的归来。虽然他不受欢迎，但对于大多数人来说，李的力量过于强大，无法推翻。\n\n对李来说，纳粹的色彩正照亮着挪威光明的未来。但对于其他大部分人来说，挪威的未来从未如此黯淡。"
 POLITICS_EINAR_GERHARDSEN_DESC: "After decades of oppression under the Nazi boot, democracy has finally returned to Norway. Møyen has departed from the top office gracefully and smoothly, and it's said by many that the man replacing him could not be a better fit for the new Norway. If Møyen was the father of the post-German Norway, than Einar Gerhardsen is certainly the ideal son.\n\nEinar Gerhardsen was born in 1897, spending his early years bouncing from profession to profession before finally joining the Labor Party, becoming a top party official all the way up to the German invasion. The war years would not be kind to Gerhardsen, as he lost his positions, was captured after he joined the resistance, and remained in prison for the next 9 years. When he was released, he would soon rejoin the resistance, working with Møyen to rally the general population through propaganda and resistance newspapers. This work would lead to great reward, with Gerhardsen riding next to Møyen in the victory parade after the Milorg takeover. With his Labor Party relegalized, Gerhardsen would quickly retake the mantle of the Party, leading it to a great electoral victory and becoming Norway's new Prime Minister.\n\nGerhardsen's policies in office are ambitious, western, and not too dissimilar from neighboring Sweden. Progressive taxes, social security, industrialization- all are major domestic goals for the new Labor platform. Unsurprisingly, Gerhardsen's foreign policy is heavily pro-OFN, as he seeks to expand ties with the west to protect the Kingdom from the German eagle.\n\nWith Gerhardsen in charge, Norway takes its first full steps forward into a new era- one not of fear and subservience, but one of progress and freedom."
 POLITICS_GUNNAR_GARBO_DESC: "Gunnar Garbo is a walking puzzle. His policies and positions have stumped many analysts. He claims to be a centrist, moderate choice for Norway, yet holds more socially progressive positions than his other moderate contenders. He represents the Left, a liberal party, but decries what he calls an \"excess of economic liberalism\". It's a common joke that he looks more to the left than he does to the Left, his own party. However, these questions have captured the interest of the public, as now Garbo takes the reigns of a new Norway.\n\nBorn in 1924, Garbo was only a teen when the Nazi's landed on Norway's shores. He joined his father as an active resistance journalist. His father would lose his head for his work, and Garbo was forced to flee to Sweden for a period of time before returning to Milorg during the 50's. From there, he made his way up through the Left's apparatus, finally taking the chairman's position as Milorg marched on Oslo. After a fierce electoral competition, Garbo reached the top of the mountain, becoming Prime Minister.\n\nGarbo's policies are an eclectic mix of social progressivism and restrained economic liberalism. His policies also have taken a surprisingly environmental turn, with multiple movements to protect Norway's natural beauty. Many of his economic policies are mixes of the regulations of the Social Democrats and the free market economics of the Conservatives. Overall, Garbo's policies are confusing, exciting, and highly experimental.\n\nGarbo is many things, but as long as he stays around in Norway's politics, there will always be one thing that all can be sure of- he's a very interesting man."
 POLITICS_ALV_KJOS_DESC: "The first election in the new Norway's history was expected to mainly be a contest between the center-left factions in Norwegian politics, with the Conservative party only expected to play as spoiler. However, the polls clearly underestimated the charisma of Alv Kjøs, the man who took the Conservatives from disaster to victory, the man who now takes over from Møyen as leader of Norway.\n\nKjøs was born into a farming family, but quickly set his sights on a military career. His decision seemed destined to bear fruit, as he was promoted to major by 1940, but all plans would be thrown aside when the Germans landed on Norwegian shores. Kjøs was captured early on, and could only watch helplessly from behind the barbed wire as his beloved nation was crushed beneath the Nazi boot. When the war came to an end, and POWs were finally released, Kjøs quickly joined the resistance, fighting tirelessly for Norway's freedom. As with his military career, so did his tenure with the resistance bear fruit, as he rode triumphantly into Oslo alongside his counterparts. Finally, as he entered politics on the side of the Right, his message of economic liberalism, state protestantism, and industrialization caught fire with the Norwegian people, who elected him to their highest office.\n\nKjøs now gets to work on fulfilling his promises. Already, curious businesses sniff the air in Norway for new opportunities, and factories already lay their foundations from Oslo to Narvik. The religious right celebrates the return of Protestantism as a state religion. Questions still surround Kos on whether he can keep the momentum of the Right going, or how well his new Norway will actually do, but for now, all of Norway can sleep soundly knowing that a steady hand controls the ship of state."
 POLITICS_KNUT_LOFSNES_DESC: "Knut Løfsnes should not be where he is today. He was not a member of Milorg, or any of its affiliates. His political positions, in the eyes of almost all analysts, were well to the left of what even a nation like Norway would accept. His base consisted solely of students and communists. To any reasonable person, Løfsnes stood no chance against the other titans he was running against.\n\nAnd yet, Løfsnes has won.\n\nA teacher before the war, Løfsnes joined the resistance quickly. He was captured, released, and fled to Sweden before anything else could happen to him. Once in Stockholm, Løfsnes would work with the XU unit, feeding information to the Allies, even when all hope of victory was lost. Finally, with the war over, Løfsnes returned to Norway to continue the fight. He would participate in the march on Oslo, though nowhere near the front of the parade, and set up his own Socialist People's Party to run in the upcoming election. Despite the odds being stacked so heavily against him, the Socialists would pull out a victory in the final election, stunning Norway.\n\nLøfsnes's policies have brought much speculation onto the future of Norway. Unlike any other candidate, Løfsnes has demonstrated a reluctance to join with the OFN, instead preferring a neutral approach that some may fear is impossible.\n\nHowever, the most worrying- or, in his supporter's eyes, appealing- aspect of Løfsnes's positions is his total refusal to even consider a deal with the Germans. For some, this shows Løfsnes's dedication to keeping Norway free. For others, it spells the certain doom of the restored Kingdom. Norway's future, as much as it is speculated about, rests on shaky ground. Can it survive the German century?"
 POLITICS_HENRIK_ROGSTAD_DESC: "Unlike his many Nasjonal Samling comrades harbouring secret resentment towards the Reich, Henrik Rogstad is a proud Pan-Germanist through and through. Determination and loyalty saw this former leader of the NS youth movement rise through the Norwegian political scene until he settled into a modest administrative position under Josef Terboven, a platform he used to openly endorse the radical wing of his Party. With the bureaucratic skills accumulated throughout his political life and the strict discipline drilled into him by his service in the Hirden, Rogstad harshly reigns as the new Fører of Norway.\n\nSince the dismantlement of Terboven's administration, Rogstad's fervent dedication to the German Reich has only strengthened, leading to an infamous reputation among Norwegians all across the political spectrum - and even within his own Party. The Fører's cohorts praise him as the only man strong enough to haul Norway back into greatness, while his opponents decry him as little more than a tinpot dictator dancing on German strings to the tune of the Führer's demands."
 NOR_byzantine_politics: "繁杂政治"
 NOR_byzantine_politics_desc: "The political and bureaucratic system of the Reichsprotektorat is a confusing clutter of petty tyrants, factionalism and overlapping authority between the Germans, the NS and sometimes, the SS that lacks support among the people.

 NOR_sami_issue_desc: "The northern areas of the Reichsprotektorat have an indigenous people living there, the Sami. Since the end of the 1800s the Norwegians had conducted a program of Norwegianization of that people, but this was stopped after a direct order from Himmler who wished to preserve the Sami way of life. Now they exist in a legal limbo, presenting a problem that most would rather just forget about."

 NOR_the_overstayed_occupation: "The Extended Occupation"
 NOR_the_overstayed_occupation_desc: "When the German Reich conquered Norway and established a Reichskommissariat under the leadership of Josef Terboven, it was promised to be a temporary measure. Once the Allies were defeated, we claimed, the nation would be left in the capable hands of a Nasjonal Samling regime. Over twenty years later, Norway continues to be occupied by German troops and governed by German officials. Quisling, once destined to be the great Fører of Norway, was shamefully forced out of power by a populace whose fury is fueled by the continued Occupation and stoked by active resistance movements. Just how long this occupation will last has been a question on the lips of every Norwegian for the last two decades."
 NOR_Milorg: "军事抵抗组织"
 NOR_Milorg_desc: "Since the Occupation of Norway, certain groups have defied our rule through disruption, assassination and sabotage. No group has been as powerful or as prevalent as Milorg, the militant resistance movement that has violently fought against our rule for over twenty years. These rebels continue to be a sharp thorn in our side despite our strongest efforts to stamp them out. As long as Milorg remains active and undefeated, they will continue to harass our administration with impunity."

 NOR_argricultural_devolution_desc: "The Occupation heralded many seismic changes for the Norwegian people as a whole, but none have affected the individual man and woman as much as the declining economy. For two decades the Reichskommissariat's administration has continued to enforce a strict policy of forced agrarianism, leading to what many have mockingly labelled as an \"agricultural devolution\". This program has only continued to attract greater controversy with each passing year, largely due to the lack of arable land and the alleged ties between rural farmers and resistance cells. As long as this chaotic policy continues to cause a significant downturn of the economy, it will be loathed by the Norwegian people."
 NOR_Olav_V: "国王奥拉夫五世"
 NOR_Olav_V_desc: "During the chaos of the Second World War, Prince Olav provided stable and courageous leadership, advising both civilian and military leaders in the struggle against the German foe. The German Occupation forced him to flee into exile, but his presence among many Norwegian circles remained as strong as ever. As the Occupation extended, so too did the exiled royal continue to preach his nation's freedom from afar, growing as a powerful symbol of Norwegian independence and national unity. At long last, Olav has now returned to claim his throne as the rightful King of Norway."
 NOR_collab_purge: "Legal Purge"
 NOR_collab_purge_desc: "When we first read about the Nazi tyrants to the south, revulsion stirred within us. When these tyrants despoiled this beautiful nation with their extended Occupation, our revulsion boiled into hatred. Yet these feelings are nothing in comparison to the sheer loathing we bear towards those of Norwegian blood who betrayed their own brethren. We are enacting a widespread Legal Purge against the collaborationist leaders within Norway to rid this country of their treacherous filth; whether they answered to the Horst Wessel Lied or the clinking of coins, we shall place them on trial for all the world to see. Those Norwegians who stood by the German brutes while their fellow people were murdered and deported will meet their fate at the hands of our new justice system. The Legal Purge has begun."
 NOR_protect_norway: "For Everything We Have"
 NOR_protect_norway_desc: "For the average Norwegian, the loss of their homeland to the Germans twenty years ago still lingers in living memory. With Norway standing on its own two feet once more, the Norwegian people would ensure such a tragedy would never happen again. For every inch of plain, hill, valley, fjord, or mountain, the Norwegian people would resist and fight to the bitter end."

Now with the Germans gone, Norway may now finally restore what it has lost, one step at a time."
